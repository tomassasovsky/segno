# Tests for `segno-wifi-regdom` (#459).
#
# Whether the kernel actually honours a country code needs a radio, so `iw` is
# stubbed and every path is injected. What that leaves is the part that decides
# whether a 5 GHz network works at all: which country is chosen, and whether a
# bad answer is loud or silent.
#
# The bug this exists to prevent was silent in the worst way. `[device]
# wifi.country=AR` sat in NetworkManager's config looking correct for months
# and did nothing, because that is not a NetworkManager property. Nothing
# logged, nothing failed — 5 GHz just associated and then timed out, and
# NetworkManager blamed the password. So the rule here is that this script
# never fails quietly: it either sets a domain and says so, or says why not.
