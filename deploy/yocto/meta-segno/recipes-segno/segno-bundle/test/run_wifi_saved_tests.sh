# Tests for saved-network visibility and autoconnect priority (#471, #463).
#
# Both bugs are about a saved profile the user cannot see or outrank. Together
# they trapped a console during #459: a saved network that would not connect
# kept winning autoconnect (every profile got the same priority, so
# NetworkManager broke the tie by timestamp), and it could not be forgotten
# from the UI because the list only showed what the last scan returned — and a
# network that will not connect is rarely the one you are connected to.
