# that key takes precedence over the themes/default.plymouth symlink — so despite the
# plymouth-segno-theme recipe pointing default.plymouth at segno, boot loaded two-step.so
# and showed the circular spinner. Repoint the distro default at segno so script.so (our
# theme engine) is loaded instead. The default.plymouth symlink remains as a fallback.
