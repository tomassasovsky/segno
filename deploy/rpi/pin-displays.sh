# Pin the floor console's two displays deterministically by connector name, so
# the 16" main-UI panel and the 7" waveform panel never swap across reboots
# (the output-naming race called out in the Part 5 plan). Uses wlr-randr, which
# the Part-1 compositor (labwc, wlroots-based) exposes via
# wlr-output-management.
#
# Connector names depend on wiring; list them with `wlr-randr`. The 7" may be
# HDMI-A-2 (HDMI) or DSI-1 (the official DSI panel — decided in the Part-6
# HDMI-vs-DSI spike). EDIT the names/resolutions/scales below to match the unit.
#
# UNVERIFIED on hardware — confirm connector names and that the mapping holds
# across >=5 reboots (the real Part 5 acceptance gate).
