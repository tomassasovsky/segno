#!/bin/sh
# Boot-time integrity check for the console's writable data partition (where the
# app's settings + sessions live, separate from the read-only root — see
# deploy/rpi/overlayfs/README.md). Runs as root from the kiosk unit's
# `ExecStartPre=+` so it can fsck and mount.
#
# A non-interactive fsck repairs a partition left dirty by a power-cut. On
# success it mounts the partition and clears the unhealthy marker. On an
# unrecoverable partition it drops a marker (SEGNO_BAD_MARKER) and still exits 0
# so the unit proceeds to start-kiosk.sh, which shows the "needs attention"
# screen rather than respawn-looping.
#
# The check is OPT-IN: it only applies when the overlayfs data partition is in
# use. Set SEGNO_DATA_DEV to that partition (the overlayfs default is
# /dev/mmcblk0p3) to enable it; it must NOT be in the boot-time fstab automount
# (this script mounts it after fsck). On a stock single-partition SD card — no
# SEGNO_DATA_DEV and no p3 — there is nothing to check and the app boots normally.
#
# UNVERIFIED on hardware — confirm the device node + mount flow on a real Pi.
