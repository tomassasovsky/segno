# Build the Pro Micro (32U4) pedal firmware to a flashable .hex.
#
# The single source of truth for HOW this firmware is compiled. Both CI jobs
# call it — the PR gate (main.yaml) so a firmware break fails the PR that caused
# it, and the release job (appliance-release.yml) so the published .hex is
# byte-for-byte the thing the gate proved buildable. Keeping one recipe is the
# point: two copies would drift, and the drift would only surface at release.
#
# Usage: build.sh <out-dir> [version]
#
# Writes:
#   <out-dir>/segno-pedal-<version>.hex   the firmware image
#   <out-dir>/protocol-version            the wire protocol it speaks ("3")
#
# Requires arduino-cli on PATH with the arduino:avr core installed; the sketch's
# own libraries are installed here (see below).

# string is what console auto-detect matches on (#421). Compiling without them
# yields a .hex that enumerates as a stock "Arduino Leonardo" and never
# auto-binds on a console that has no picker to fall back on.
