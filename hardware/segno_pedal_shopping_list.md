# Segno Pedal — Local Shopping List (Argentina)

Quantities are **per pedal**. Building two? Double everything except the modules/PCBs counts noted.
All parts are standard and available at local electronics shops / MercadoLibre.

## Bare PCBs (2 boards)
No cheap local equivalent in Argentina. The expensive shipping was the **parts** order — two light bare PCBs ship cheaply from **JLCPCB on their own**:
- [ ] `hardware/kicad/fab/segno_pedal_main_gerbers.zip` → JLCPCB (PCB only, no assembly)
- [ ] `hardware/kicad/fab/segno_pedal_ring_gerbers.zip` → JLCPCB (PCB only, no assembly)

*(Or use a local Argentine PCB fab to avoid the import entirely.)*

### Notes
- Verified caps: **K104K10X7RF5UH5** (Vishay) and **CCT104K85X7RF5FH5A0** (SHM) are both 100 nF / 50 V / X7R / 5 mm-pitch — exact-fit drop-ins. Any equivalent 100 nF 50 V "104" with ~5 mm leads works (bend the leads if pitch differs).
- Pro Micro is powered via **RAW** from the reverse-protected 9 V — the 7–12 V Vin rating is required.
- 9 V barrel jack is wired **centre-negative** (Boss / pedal standard).
- Faceplate **RESET** button (to J20) and an external **ICSP** programmer plug into the headers above for firmware recovery.
