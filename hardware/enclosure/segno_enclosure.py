"""Segno — parametric sheet-metal enclosure for the segno Pi loopstation.

Generates a **manufacturing package** for a wedge-shaped floor console modelled on
the "Chewie II" / Sonnit reference (850 x 465 x 100 mm, top sloping toward the
player), housing this repo's standalone build: a Raspberry Pi 4/5 running segno,
the segno_pedal_main board, ten foot pedals, the EC11 encoder + diffused LED ring,
SMD LED-strip status indicators (WS2812B segments behind diffuser slots) and a
7" + 16" touchscreen pair. Branded **Segno**.

Construction (see ../segno_enclosure_design.md and
../../docs/plan/2026-06-27-feat-segno-enclosure-rework-plan.md):

  WELDED LOWER BODY (one rigid tray)        REMOVABLE TOP LID
  - front wall (12) + top flange (ledge)    - faceplate pan (sloped top, all cutouts)
  - rear wall (100) + I/O + vents + flange    + down-turned front/side/rear skirts
  - 2x side panel + top flange (ledge)        (lid screws on the SKIRTS, not the top)
  - bottom plate (welded, vented, Pi/board) - 2x screen-retention bracket
  - 10x inner pedal platform (welded)

Foot controls = ten Cherub WTB-006 footswitches (109.87x76.35, 29.3 mm tall with
anti-slip pads; caliper-measured, see hardware/cherub_wtb006_pedal/) standing
toe-forward on printed pedestals, protruding through ~79x113 mm slots. No
top-face fasteners; pedal wiring stays internal. Service = back out the side +
front-lip screws and lift the lid (screens + ring PCB + LEDs go with it; pedals
stay on their platforms).

Geometry is validated by an **assertion suite** (`_check()`) run before any output,
so "the generator runs" means the geometry is valid (width budget, no overlapping
cutouts, platform head-room, screen depth, vent free-area, bezel overlap).

Outputs (./out, mm): STEP (assembly + per-part), DXF flat patterns
(CUT/BEND/ENGRAVE/WELD/VENT layers), PDF drawing sheets.

Run with the bundled venv (cadquery + ezdxf + matplotlib):
    .venv/bin/python segno_enclosure.py            # check + STEP + DXF + PDF
    .venv/bin/python segno_enclosure.py --report   # report + checks only
