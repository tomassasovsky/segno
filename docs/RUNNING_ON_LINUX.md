# Running Segno on Linux

Segno runs natively on Linux (GTK). The native engine + miniaudio compile and
bundle as `libsegno_engine.so`.

Most "it doesn't work on Linux" reports are **host/interface configuration**, not
Segno. This doc captures what was learned bringing it up on a Focusrite Clarett+
8Pre, so the next person doesn't spend an evening on it.

## Backend: JACK (not PulseAudio)

On a PipeWire system miniaudio's **PulseAudio** backend returns **silent capture
buffers** (verified: a connected source reads as pure silence through pulse, but
fine through JACK/`pw-record`). So the engine prefers the **JACK** backend on
Linux ([engine.c](../packages/segno_engine/src/engine.c), `le_engine_start`):
JACK → PulseAudio → ALSA. PipeWire ships a JACK server, so this needs no extra
setup, and JACK exposes the full multichannel interface (ALSA only offers a
2-channel bridge, and the raw `hw:` device is busy while PipeWire holds it).

Consequences of the JACK backend:

- **Buffer size = the PipeWire quantum.** JACK takes its buffer from the server,
  so the engine both exports `PIPEWIRE_QUANTUM=<buffer>/<rate>` (wins on the first
  connection) and forces the graph quantum globally via `pw-metadata` (a per-app
  request loses to another driver's quantum on a reopen). The in-app **Buffer
  size** selector therefore controls latency directly; default is 256 frames
  (~5 ms). The dynamic quantum is restored when the engine stops or exits — but a
  crash leaves it forced (`pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-quantum 0`
  resets it).
- **Generic device name.** JACK reports a single "Default … Device", so the
  status shows the *selected* device's name instead.
- **Ports are pinned to the selected device.** miniaudio's JACK backend would
  otherwise auto-connect to *every* aggregated physical port (all devices), so
  channels land on the wrong hardware and the channel count is inflated. After
  the device opens, the engine rewires its ports to only the selected interface's
  `<name>:capture_*` / `:playback_*` ports (in numeric order, skipping monitor
  ports) and reports just that device's channel count — so I/O maps to your
  interface like on CoreAudio. **Select the interface as both input and output**;
  pinning keys off the selected device ids.
- **Latency calibration is per (device, sample-rate, buffer).** Measure
  round-trip latency *after* choosing your buffer; changing the buffer needs a
  re-measure. The measurement needs a physical out→in loopback cable (it detects
  the tone burst on the real input channels by cross-correlation).

## Renderer: Impeller is disabled

Impeller (the default renderer on Linux/GTK as of Flutter 3.44) mis-rasterizes the
bundled Material icon font — icons render as empty "tofu" boxes. The GTK runner
([linux/runner/main.cc](../linux/runner/main.cc)) forces the Skia backend by
appending `enable-impeller=false` to the engine switches, so no `flutter run` flag
is needed. Remove that call once Linux Impeller matures.

## Audio device selection

- **Select your interface as both input and output** in the Audio tab. The engine
  pins its JACK ports to exactly that device (see "Ports are pinned" above); with
  no selection it falls back to miniaudio's aggregate auto-connect.
- An explicit input selection always wins over loopback auto-routing — important
  on PipeWire, where every output sink exposes a "Monitor of …" source that the
  cable-free latency feature would otherwise auto-pick as the capture device.
- **Other apps can still steal a channel.** PipeWire lets any client grab an
  interface input (e.g. the GNOME Settings input meter takes the first one or two
  channels); the engine only repins ports it owns, so close such apps (or point
  them at a different device) if a channel reads silence.
- Keep the engine at **48 kHz** for the widest channel count on USB interfaces
  (see below).

## Focusrite (Clarett+/Scarlett) on Linux — the `scarlett2` driver

There is no Focusrite Control on Linux; the `snd-usb-audio` **`scarlett2`** mixer
(`alsamixer -c <card>`, `amixer -c <card>`) controls routing/levels instead. The
defaults differ from a macOS Focusrite-Control setup, which is why an identical
interface can look broken:

- **Channel count is sample-rate-dependent (USB altset).** The Clarett+ 8Pre
  exposes 18 in / 20 out only at 44.1/48 kHz; 14/16 at 88.2/96 kHz; 10/10 at
  176.4/192 kHz. Run at **48 kHz** for all channels.
- **Use the PipeWire "Pro Audio" profile** to expose all channels as raw
  multichannel: `pactl set-card-profile <card-id> pro-audio`. The default
  "Multichannel" profile may negotiate a reduced-channel altset.
- **Output routing:** physical outputs default to the internal **Mix** (e.g.
  `Analogue Output 01 ← Mix A`), not USB playback — so app audio is silent until
  you route them to PCM:
  `amixer -c <card> cset numid=<n> "PCM 1"` (find the `Analogue Output NN Playback
  Enum` numids with `amixer -c <card> controls`).
- **Capture routing** defaults are usually correct (`PCM 01 ← Analogue 1`, …);
  verify with the `PCM NN Capture Enum` controls.
- **Monitor level, input gain, and 48V phantom power are hardware-controlled** and
  **not exposed** by `scarlett2` for this model — use the knobs/buttons on the unit.
  A weak input that the gain knob barely changes is the classic symptom of a
  condenser mic with **48V off** (press it on the device).

### Diagnosing signal level (no Segno needed)

PipeWire sources are shared, so you can measure in parallel with Segno. Per-channel
input peak:

```bash
timeout 4 pw-record --target <node.name> --channels <n> --rate 48000 --format s16 /tmp/in.wav
python3 -c "import wave,array,math;w=wave.open('/tmp/in.wav');d=array.array('h');d.frombytes(w.readframes(w.getnframes()));ch=w.getnchannels()
print([round(max((abs(d[i+c]) for i in range(0,len(d),ch)),default=0)/32768,4) for c in range(ch)])"
```

Record the sink's `.monitor` to see exactly what Segno is sending out. If the input
shows signal but the output `.monitor` is flat, the problem is Segno; if both move
together, Segno is fine and it's a host level/routing issue.
