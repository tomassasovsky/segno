# Performance manifest format (`performance.json`)

Part 6 of the performance-recording / DAW-export umbrella
(`docs/plan/2026-07-05-feat-performance-recording-daw-export-plan.md`). This
pins the schema of `performance.json`, the sidecar manifest that is the
**canonical machine-readable record** of a performance capture — the input
`daw_export` (parts 9-10) and the offline renderer (parts 7-8) build fixtures
and read logic against. It is written so a reader can parse the file without
importing engine or Dart code — every field is plain JSON.

## Where it lives

`performance.json` sits at the root of a capture's bundle directory
(`{documents}/exports/perf-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`, D-NAME) alongside `events.log`
(`docs/design/performance-event-log-format.md`), the raw/finalized master and
input PCM, and `loops/`. Unlike `events.log`, it is **atomically replaced**,
not appended to: `perf_drain.c` rewrites it in full every ~250ms while armed,
and `performance_repository` (`packages/performance_repository`) rewrites it
once more at finalize (normal disarm, or crash recovery) to fold in the
fields below `finalized: true`.

## Two authors, one file

| Phase | Author | Fields written |
|---|---|---|
| While armed (~250ms cadence) | `perf_drain.c` (native) | `slug`, `sample_rate`, `channel_layout`, `capture_frames`, `overrun_count`, `overrun_gaps`, `layers`, `stopped_early?`, `finalized: false` (always) |
| At finalize (disarm, or crash recovery) | `performance_repository` (Dart) | `armSnapshot`, `disarmSnapshot?`, `finalized: true` — every native field above is preserved verbatim, never re-derived |

A reader only ever needs to parse the file **once it is finalized**
(`finalized: true`) to see the complete picture; a capture found with
`finalized` absent or `false` is either still in progress or is exactly what
`PerformanceRepository.findUnfinalized` flags for crash recovery (D-SALVAGE).

## Salvage sibling files (`.boot-recovery`, `.recovered-at`)

Boot-time crash salvage (D-SALVAGE, silent since #679) leaves two tiny
sibling files beside `performance.json` at different points of a bundle's
life. They exist because `finalized` alone cannot carry the whole salvage
story: a finished take the user kept and a salvage output stranded mid-move
are **byte-identical by sidecar**, and filesystem mtimes are too fragile to
hang provenance or retention on (copies and moves rewrite them; an RTC-less
console boots near the epoch until its first NTP sync).

| File | Format | Written by | Removed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.boot-recovery` | empty file (its presence is the datum) | `PerformanceRepository.runBootRecovery`, immediately before a bundle's salvage begins | the move into `recovered/` completing — its deletion is what declares the salvage done |
| `.recovered-at` | epoch milliseconds, UTF-8 text, nothing else | the same move, stamped on the **source** bundle strictly before the rename, so the rename carries it atomically | never — it stays with the bundle as its retention clock for as long as it lives under `recovered/` |

What a standalone tool should conclude from each combination:

| Observation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `finalized` `false`/absent (exports root) | still armed, or crashed while armed — the salvage candidate `findUnfinalized` flags; `.boot-recovery` may also be present from an earlier attempt that could not finalize |
| `finalized: true` + `.boot-recovery` (exports root) | **stranded salvage output**: finalize completed but the move to `recovered/` did not (a crash in that window, or a stem-render timeout); the next boot re-attempts the render and finishes the move |
| `finalized: true`, no `.boot-recovery` (exports root) | a normal finished take — never touched by salvage or pruning |
| `.recovered-at` present (under `recovered/`) | landed there via salvage at the stamped instant; pruned once `PerformanceRepository.recoveredRetention` (30 days) has elapsed **from that stamp** |
| under `recovered/` without `.recovered-at` | not placed there by the salvage (e.g. dragged in by hand) — never pruned, no matter its age |

## Top-level fields

```jsonc
{
  "slug": "perf-20260706-143015",
  "sample_rate": 48000,
  "channel_layout": { "master_channels": 2, "captured_inputs": [0, 1] },
  "capture_frames": 4800000,
  "overrun_count": 0,
  "overrun_gaps": [ { "frame": 12000, "duration_frames": 64 } ],
  "layers": [ /* see below */ ],
  "stopped_early": "disk_full",
  "armSnapshot": { /* see below */ },
  "disarmSnapshot": { /* see below */ },
  "finalized": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | string | The bundle directory's own name (D-NAME); redundant with the path but kept so the file is self-describing if moved. |
| `sample_rate` | int | Negotiated device sample rate at arm time. Every PCM file in the bundle shares this rate (D-RATE — no resampling). |
| `channel_layout.master_channels` | int | Channel count of `master.pcm`/`master.wav` (D-MASTER: stereo, or mono on a mono device). |
| `channel_layout.captured_inputs` | int[] | Hardware input indices monitored at arm time (frozen for the session, D-INPUT); each has an `input-<n>.pcm` / `live-input-<n>.wav`. |
| `capture_frames` | int | Total frames elapsed since arm, regardless of any ring drop. In a MID-CAPTURE sidecar this is elapsed *as of that cycle's start*, not as of the moment the file was written (the cycle samples the frame count before it drains a single ring — see #710 — so audio produced while the cycle was writing is counted next cycle instead). The final sidecar is unaffected, since no audio is produced after it; only a crash-recovered bundle, whose newest sidecar is a mid-capture one, ever sees the difference. |
| `overrun_count` | int | Capture-ring overruns (frames the audio thread could not enqueue) since arm. Not the whole story — see `zero_filled_frames`. |
| `zero_filled_frames` | int | Frames of digital silence the drain actually wrote into the capture files since arm, summed over every file it writes. A superset of `overrun_count`'s consequences: every dropped frame is silence-filled, but a file can also fall behind for reasons no overrun explains, which is how #710's takes carried audible silence while `overrun_count` read `0`. Counts bytes that reached disk, so a pad the disk refused (a `disk_full` stop mid-pad) is excluded even though `overrun_gaps` may still name the span. Absent from any sidecar written before #710. |
| `overrun_gaps` | array | Up to 128 individually-logged `{frame, duration_frames}` gaps — where a file fell behind and by how much it was *asked* to pad. Beyond 128, frames are still silence-filled, just not itemized here; `zero_filled_frames` stays exact regardless. |
| `layers` | array | Every retired overdub layer's raw PCM, persisted before pool eviction/clear/redo could destroy it (part 5, D-LAYER) — see below. |
| `stopped_early` | string? | `"disk_full"` or `"device_changed"` when capture stopped abnormally; absent for a normal disarm. |
| `armSnapshot` | object? | See below. `null`/absent only if the app crashed before arm's own crash-survival file (`arm-snapshot.json`, deleted at finalize) could even be written. |
| `disarmSnapshot` | object? | See below. Absent for a capture recovered from a crash — there is no live engine left for a second pass. |
| `finalized` | bool | `true` once finalize completed. The salvage *trigger* (D-SALVAGE): `false`/absent is what routes a bundle to crash recovery — but since the silent boot salvage (#679) it is no longer the sole salvage marker; the `.boot-recovery` / `.recovered-at` sibling files carry the move-and-retention half of the story (see "Salvage sibling files" above). |

### `layers[]` entries (part 5, unchanged by part 6)

```jsonc
{ "channel": 1, "slot": 4, "generation": 2, "frame": 4800, "frame_count": 480, "lane_count": 1, "filename": "layer-1-4800-4.pcm" }
```

`frame` is a best-effort, buffer-granularity snapshot (not sample-accurate);
cross-reference `channel`/`slot`/`generation` against `events.log`'s
`LE_PLOG_LAYER_RETIRED` entries for the exact retire frame. These raw files
are **not** copied into `loops/` — they exist for the offline renderer (parts
7-8) to reconstruct overdub-pass-by-pass audibility, not as a directly
playable deliverable of this part.

## `armSnapshot`

The state captured at the arm instant — everything the offline renderer and
`.als` generator need to establish t=0, since the engine snapshot alone
cannot supply the FX chains of any stage, monitor configuration, or the limiter
state (those live in `performance_repository`'s caller-supplied
`PerformanceChains`, mirroring how `session_repository`'s `SessionChains` works
for session saves).

```jsonc
{
  "clockFrame": 0,
  "masterLenFrames": 96000,
  "masterGain": 1.0,
  "limiterOn": true,
  "limiterCeiling": 0.99,
  "latencyOffsetFrames": 128,
  "fxStagesVersion": 1,
  "tracks": [ /* see below */ ],
  "monitors": [
    { "input": 0, "enabled": true, "outputMask": 3, "volume": 1.0, "muted": false, "chainEnabled": false, "effects": [ /* see FX entries */ ] }
  ],
  "trackChains": [
    { "channel": 0, "chainEnabled": false, "effects": [ /* see FX entries */ ] }
  ],
  "masterEffects": [ /* see FX entries */ ],
  "masterChainEnabled": false
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `clockFrame` | Master playhead position at the arm instant. |
| `masterLenFrames` | Master loop length in frames at arm time. |
| `masterGain` | Master output gain at arm time. |
| `limiterOn` / `limiterCeiling` | Master peak limiter state at arm time. |
| `latencyOffsetFrames` | The active device profile's record-offset latency compensation. |
| `fxStagesVersion` | FX-stage schema revision (FX v3, R20): `1` = the four-stage model below. **Absent = a legacy snapshot** written before those fields existed; see "FX stages" below. |
| `tracks` | One entry per **non-empty** track (empty tracks are omitted); carries the **Loop** stage, per lane. |
| `monitors` | The **Input** stage: one entry per hardware input the caller supplied chain/routing state for. Each entry's `chainEnabled` is that monitor chain's bypass flag, written only when `false` (absent = engaged, or legacy — see the marker below); `enabled` beside it is the input's own monitor gate, not an FX flag. |
| `trackChains` | The **Track** stage: one entry per track channel with bus FX or a non-default chain flag. Omitted when there are none. |
| `masterEffects` / `masterChainEnabled` | The **Master** insert's entries and chain flag. `masterEffects` is omitted when empty; `masterChainEnabled` is omitted while engaged (i.e. absent = `true`). |

### FX stages and the presence-keyed version marker

The snapshot records all four FX stages of the v3 model, each with its
chain-level bypass flag alongside its entries (which carry their own `enabled`
bits): Input (`monitors[]`), Loop (`tracks[].lanes[]`), Track (`trackChains[]`)
and Master (`masterEffects`/`masterChainEnabled`). A replay seeds arm-time
bypass state from these rather than assuming everything was audible (R3).

Every flag is written **only when disabled**, so a rig with no bypassed chain
produces the same bytes a pre-FX-v3 build did. `fxStagesVersion` is what makes
that ambiguity readable: it is always written by current code, so

- marker present, flag absent → the chain was **engaged**;
- marker absent → a **legacy** snapshot: the bus stages were not captured at all
  and no chain or slot could be bypassed, so a reader defaults the bus stages
  empty and everything enabled.

There is no version `switch` on the read side — the parse is presence-keyed
field by field, matching the session manifest's own migration style.

### `tracks[]` entries

```jsonc
{ "channel": 0, "state": "playing", "volume": 1.0, "muted": false, "multiple": 1, "lanes": [ /* see below */ ] }
```

`state` is one of the native `le_track_state` names: `empty`, `recording`,
`overdubbing`, `playing`, `stopped`.

### `lanes[]` entries — the ER diagram's `LANE_SNAPSHOT` + `FX_ENTRY`

```jsonc
{ "lane": 0, "lenFrames": 96000, "deferred": false, "pcmRef": "loops/track0-lane0.wav", "chainEnabled": false, "effects": [ { "type": 3, "params": [0.35, 0.35, 0.35, 0.0], "slotId": "3f2a91c7-4" } ] }
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `lane` | Lane index within the track. |
| `lenFrames` | Captured length in frames; `0` when `deferred`. |
| `chainEnabled` | The lane chain's per-chain bypass flag, written only when `false` (absent = engaged, or legacy — see the marker above). |
| `deferred` | `true` when this lane was mid-overdub at snapshot time (D-SNAP) — the audio thread was still writing its buffer, so there is no stable PCM to export here. Its content instead reaches disk via the retired-layer path (`layers[]` above) once the pass retires, or via `disarmSnapshot` if it finishes before disarm. |
| `pcmRef` | The lane's exported WAV filename, relative to the bundle directory (e.g. `loops/track0-lane0.wav`). Absent when `deferred`, or when the lane was empty. |
| `effects` | The lane's effect chain, in order, **only on an arm-time snapshot** ("chain at t=0"). Each entry is a `TrackEffect.toJson()` map verbatim: `{type, params}` for a built-in effect (`type` = the native `le_fx_type` code, `params` = up to 4 normalized `0..1` values), or `{type: 8, plugin: {...}, paramValues?, state?, name?}` for a hosted VST3/CLAP plugin (`PluginRef` identity — `daw_export`'s `fx-chains.txt`, part 10, reads this for third-party plugin identity + passthrough notes). Any entry may also carry `"enabled": false` (its own bypass; absent = audible) and `"slotId"` (its stable per-slot identity, the same id pedal bindings address). Absent (not an empty array) when there is nothing to report. |

A `disarmSnapshot` lane entry never carries `effects` **or `chainEnabled`** —
chain changes made during the performance are already in `events.log` (D-LOG),
not re-snapshotted; re-deriving "the chain at disarm" from the log plus the arm
snapshot is a downstream reader's job if it ever needs it.

This matters for the reconciliation rule below: a reader that prefers the
disarm entry (correct for **PCM**) must still read `effects` and `chainEnabled`
from the **arm** entry. A disarm entry omits `chainEnabled` unconditionally, so
taking the flag from there would report every bypassed chain as engaged.

## `disarmSnapshot`

A second, lighter settled-lane pass taken just before disarm — covers a track
**recorded fresh during the performance and then just played**: recording
finalization produces no retire event (retires are overdub-only), so without
this pass its stem would have no PCM source anywhere (D-SNAP).

```jsonc
{ "tracks": [ { "channel": 2, "state": "playing", "volume": 1.0, "muted": false, "multiple": 1, "lanes": [ { "lane": 0, "lenFrames": 48000, "deferred": false, "pcmRef": "loops/track2-lane0.wav" } ] } ] }
```

Same `tracks[]`/`lanes[]` shape as `armSnapshot`, minus `effects` (see
above) and minus the top-level clock/master/limiter/monitor fields (nothing
there needs a second capture).

## Reconciling `armSnapshot` and `disarmSnapshot` for `loops/`

A downstream reader building the full "what PCM exists for track *t* lane
*l*" picture should prefer `disarmSnapshot`'s entry when present, falling
back to `armSnapshot`'s — this is exactly what `performance_repository`
itself does when writing `loops/*.wav` (the disarm pass simply re-exports
every currently-settled lane, overwriting the file arm already wrote for
anything unchanged and adding files for anything newly settled since arm).
A lane still `deferred` in **both** snapshots has no `loops/` entry at all;
its content, if it ever retires, lives only in `layers[]`.

## Crash consistency

Because `performance.json` is atomically replaced (not appended), a crash
mid-write leaves the **previous** cycle's complete, valid file on disk — there
is no torn-file case for this format itself (the operating system's own
atomic rename guarantees that, `perf_drain.c`'s `le_pd_atomic_rename`). The
crash-detectable state **within this file** is the `finalized` flag:
absent/`false` means either "still armed" or "crashed before finalize ran,"
which `PerformanceRepository.findUnfinalized` cannot itself distinguish (nor
needs to — both cases route to the same recovery path, `recoverCapture`). A
crash in the salvage's own window — after finalize, before the move into
`recovered/` — is detectable only via the `.boot-recovery` sibling marker
("Salvage sibling files" above), since by then this file already reads
`finalized: true` exactly like a kept take's.

The one field genuinely at risk of being lost to a crash is `armSnapshot`
itself, since the drain thread's own rewrites would otherwise clobber it if it
were merged into `performance.json` immediately at arm: `performance_repository`
writes it to its own crash-survival file, `arm-snapshot.json`, right at arm
time, and only folds it into `performance.json` (deleting `arm-snapshot.json`)
once finalize actually runs — normal disarm, or `recoverCapture` reading it
back after a crash.
