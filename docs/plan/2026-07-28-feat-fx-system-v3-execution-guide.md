# FX system v3 — execution guide

> **Living document.** Any session that merges a part MUST update that part's
> Status cell (and the "Next up" line) before it ends — that is what keeps
> every future session auto-oriented. Model/effort cannot be switched by a
> running session; they are chosen at session start, which is why each part
> plan carries its recommendation in its own header.

**Epic:** [#351](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/issues/351) ·
**Plan index:** [2026-07-28-feat-fx-system-v3-plan.md](2026-07-28-feat-fx-system-v3-plan.md)

## How to start any part

1. Confirm the part's dependencies are **Merged** in the table below.
2. Open a **fresh session** (clean context) on a new worktree/branch.
3. Pick the **model + effort from the table** in the model selector.
4. Say: `/build docs/plan/2026-07-28-feat-fx-system-v3-part-<id>-plan.md`
5. The session creates the part's child issue (`stage:build` + the autonomy
   label below), builds to green, opens the PR (`Closes #<child>`,
   `stage:in-review`, gate labels), and — if labeled `autonomy:auto` —
   merges when CI is green and `/code-review` is clean.
6. **Before ending: update this table** (Status cell + Next up).

## Status

**Next up:** every app-side part is merged (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a,
5b, 6a, 6b, 7 — 7 landed as #415). **9** is in build as
[#417](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/loopy/issues/417).

What remains after that is bench/soak work that no CI job can stand in for:

- **8** (TRS jack) is unblocked but `blocked-verify` "at bench" — it needs the
  jack and an FS-6 in hand, and it consumes part 7's trigger shapes over the
  existing cable rather than adding a new control path.
- **9's appliance soak** is device-gated in the same way. Part 9's code-bearing
  slice (daw_export reader, native stomp replay, cache glyph, docs) merges on
  CI + review; the soak itself is a manual deliverable — its checklist lands in
  `docs/RUNNING_ON_RPI.md` marked NOT YET RUN, and the epic must not close on an
  unmeasured cache claim.

[#410](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/pull/410) — the #403
press/long-press gesture-helper collapse this guide called for before 6b —
is MERGED; 6b was rebased onto it.

**[B10] amendment** (from #399's review, carried forward through 5b): the
codec-level downgrade degrades **both** v3-only values below v3 — mode fx →
play AND `PedalTrackLed.blue` → green — because pre-5a firmware rejects a
frame carrying an unknown LED index wholesale. 5b's projection emits fx and
blue unconditionally; the codec alone owns the per-version degrade. The part-5a
plan's original wording ("only the mode-field downgrade differs") predates this
amendment; `PedalCodec`'s doc comments are the authority. 5b's own faceplate
labels had to learn the same lesson — they read the live `InteractionMode`,
never `frame.mode`, precisely because the wire mode is degraded in lockstep
with the LED colour.

Open items carried out of merged parts, neither blocking a new part:
- [#389](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/issues/389) (`plan-gate`, from
  3b) — a session load never writes the applied chains back to settings, so a
  cold boot after a load resurrects the previous session's **bus** chains and
  brings the Loop stage back **dry**. Needs a direction call on whether a
  session load owns the settings keys; schedule it before 4b if the Signal
  surface is meant to show trustworthy post-restart state.
- Part 2's [B4] A/B listen check — the human exit-bar item on the wet cache,
  which no CI job can stand in for.
- [#405](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/issues/405) (`plan-gate`, from
  5b) — part 5b's [A5] capture finalize was CUT from the part. Entering FX
  cancels every pending arm (so nothing can start a take the user cannot see),
  but a live capture survives into FX exactly as it does into Mute. Ending it
  needs an engine primitive that ignores quantize — a record press arms a
  loop-top finalize instead, and with the transport parked it starts a capture
  — plus a call on whether an off-grid cut is musically right at all. Not a 6b
  blocker.
- [#402](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/issues/402)
  (`blocked-verify`, from 5b) — the physical-pedal slice: mode cycle on
  hardware, FX LEDs on a v3 pedal, and a v2 pedal showing chain LEDs with the
  mode projected as mute. Everything in 5b is CI- and simulator-verified only.
- [#403](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/issues/403) (`auto`, from 5b) —
  MERGED as [#410](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/pull/410): undo, MODE
  and Stop now share one `_HoldGesture`.

Status values: `pending` → `building (#issue)` → `in-review (#PR)` →
`merged (#PR)`.

**6b notes for part 7.** The pieces 7 inherits, and the decisions behind them:

- `lib/control/binding/` holds the whole model: `FxBindingTarget` (sealed
  chain/slot), `PedalBinding` + `PedalBindingKey`, `PedalBindingSet`, and the
  `FxBindingResolver` extension on `LooperRepository`. Expression/CC bindings
  reuse the sealed target and the resolver verbatim — only the KEY type is
  new.
- The target encoding EXTENDS `FxAddress` canonical JSON rather than
  redeclaring it (R19): a chain target's string IS the address string; a slot
  target appends one `slot` key. Safe because `FxAddress.fromJson` ignores
  unknown keys.
- Bindings live in `ControlState` (`globalBindings` / `sessionBindings` /
  `heldMomentary`), not in cubit fields — the Signal chips and the assignment
  screen both rebuild on `emit`. `state.bindings` derives the A12 merge, so
  the two sets can never disagree about which applies.
- `releaseAllMomentary()` is the ONE enforcement point (B1); the restore
  VALUES stay in a private cubit map, only the held KEY set is in state.
  Part 7's CC path must funnel through the same method.
- Persistence: settings key `pedal.bindings` for globals; `Session.pedalBindings`
  (manifest **v6**, opaque, presence-keyed) for the session set, threaded
  through `SessionCubit`'s `currentPedalBindings` / `onPedalBindings` /
  `releaseHeldBindings` function seams rather than a cubit-to-cubit link. A
  save stamps the set IN FORCE (`state.bindings`), matching the repo rule that
  the live rig — not settings — is what a save captures.
- The load seam is SPLIT across `applySession` and stays that way: release
  held momentaries BEFORE (the restore has to land on the outgoing rig) and
  commit the new set AFTER the apply succeeds (a failed apply must not leave
  the surface remapped to a session that never loaded).
- Momentary capture is first-press-only (`putIfAbsent`). A repeated press with
  no release between them — a dropped NoteOff — must never re-capture the
  state the binding itself just enabled; that stranded the target on. Part 7's
  CC path carries the same guard.
- Every assignment edit persists to settings immediately; an edit made while a
  session remap is in force PROMOTES that copy to global and drops the
  override, so no edit can be silently lost on quit.

**7 notes for 8 and 9.** External MIDI shipped in #415; what the remaining
parts inherit:

- `controller_repository` owns both trigger shapes: `ContinuousBinding`
  (0..127 onto a LO/HI range, inverted ranges allowed) and `DiscreteBinding`
  (threshold with hysteresis, floored at both edges so every threshold can
  still release). Part 8's TRS jack decodes to these same bindings — it adds
  no control path of its own.
- Targets cross that package as canonical-JSON strings; the typed sealed
  targets (`FxBindingTarget` for `enabled` flips, `ControlValueTarget` for
  value writes) and their resolvers live app-side in `lib/control/binding/`,
  sharing one `chainEntriesAt` stage lookup.
- `ControlCubit` stays the single dispatch point. A learn capture is
  generation-stamped (a superseded capture's callback must not touch its
  successor), and a mapping edit releases only the held momentaries it
  strands — `releaseAllControllerMomentary` is for disconnect and capture
  start, where everything really is stranded.
- Mappings are GLOBAL (`controller.mappings`, R19), written behind a debounce
  that `close()` flushes.
- Known gaps, with no issue filed yet: track PAN is not a target (no pan exists in the engine
  at all), hosted plugin parameters are not offered (id-addressed, no setter
  at every stage), and fan-out is supported by the model but has no UI
  affordance under R28's replace-after-confirm flow. Part 9 is the natural
  home for whichever of these is worth closing.

## Ordering and parallelism

- Critical chain: **1a → 1b → {2 ∥ 3a} → 3b/4b → 5b → 6b → 7 → 8**.
- **2 and 3a run in parallel** after 1b (different sessions/worktrees).
- 0, 4a, 5a, 6a have no in-epic dependencies — slot in any time.
- Only 1a→1b→2 is a true stacked chain: mind the repo's squash-merge
  child-rebase discipline.

## Model / effort rationale

- **Fable, high or extra-high** where a mistake corrupts audio or a wire
  protocol: audio-thread/lock-free work (1a, 1b, 2), the shared type
  foundation everything builds on (3a), dual-firmware wire lockstep (5a),
  hardware (8). Part 2 is the single riskiest part (cache lifecycle) —
  use extra-high effort.
- **Opus, medium/high** for well-specified app/domain work (0, 3b, 4b, 5b,
  6b, 7, 9); `/fast` is fine for UI iteration loops (4b).
- **Sonnet** for mechanical parts: deletion (4a, low), extraction refactor
  (6a, medium).
- On `auto` parts the session merges itself once CI is green and
  `/code-review` is clean; if a judgment call appears it must stop and
  relabel (escalation is always allowed).

## Gates recap

- A PR is mergeable only when **CI is green AND `/code-review` is clean**
  (`ready-to-merge` label). `/code-review` is human-triggered.
- Docs PR [#367](https://github.com/tomassasovsky/segno/pull/367) carries
  this guide + all plans; it must merge before part child-issues start.
