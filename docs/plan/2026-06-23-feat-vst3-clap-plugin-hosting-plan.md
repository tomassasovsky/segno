## feat: VST3 & CLAP plugin hosting — Extensive (umbrella)

## Overview

Make Segno **host third-party VST3 and CLAP audio-effect plugins** as entries in
the existing per-lane and per-input FX chains. A hosted plugin appears as just
another effect "type" alongside the built-in DSP kernels (drive, filter, delay,
reverb…), slotting into the engine's existing `le_fx_vtable` as a new
`LE_FX_PLUGIN` row whose `process` callback drives an in-process plugin host.
Users can scan for installed plugins, insert one into any FX slot, tweak a bounded
set of parameters via in-app knobs, open the plugin's **own native editor window**,
and have the plugin's full state round-trip through session persistence.

Targets **all three platforms** (macOS, Windows, Linux) and **both formats** behind
one format-agnostic host abstraction, but is **sequenced macOS-first** because that
is the only production-validated platform.

**Out of scope (explicit):** exporting Segno's engine *as* a plugin (the inverse
direction) is a separate, later brainstorm. So are instrument plugins, multi-bus /
sidechain topologies, MIDI-driven plugins, and out-of-process sandboxing (named as
a future hardening phase, not MVP).

### Locked scope decisions (from planning Q&A)

| # | Decision | Choice | Consequence |
|---|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Q1** | Where a plugin may live | **Lane *and* monitor chains.** At record time, the monitor chain's plugin is serialized to its **opaque state blob** and lazily re-instantiated per recording lane on playback (a "frozen" plugin snapshot), preserving the dry-recording invariant. | Record-time path must serialize plugin state, not value-copy a live instance ([D-P1](#decisions)). |
| **Q2** | In-app parameter surface | **Native editor + first-N knobs.** The plugin card renders the first `N` (= `kPluginKnobs`, default 4) *automatable* params as in-app knobs, plus an **Open Editor** button for the full native window. | UI delta is bounded; full control lives in the native window + two-way sync. |
| **Q3** | RT / crash posture | **Sanitize + documented best-effort.** Plugin output is denormal-flushed and NaN/Inf-sanitized at the slot boundary. An in-process plugin *can* stall or crash the engine — blast radius documented honestly. **No** watchdog or sandbox in MVP; out-of-process is a named future phase. | No new audio-thread watchdog machinery in MVP; one cheap sanitize pass added. |

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The engine was designed for this from day one — both the FX vtable
([engine_fx.c:904](../../packages/segno_engine/src/core/engine_fx.c)) and the
`le_fx_type` enum
([segno_engine_api.h:169](../../packages/segno_engine/src/core/segno_engine_api.h))
carry comments stating a hosted VST3/CLAP plugin can "later slot in as just another
row whose `process` calls the plugin host." VST3 relicensed to **MIT** (VST 3.8,
Oct 2025) and CLAP is **MIT**, so neither blocks the MIT engine core.

But the current model assumes every FX slot is a **stateless 4-float pure function**
the audio thread can null-guard and reset for free:

- `LE_FX_PARAMS` is hardcoded to **4 normalized floats** per slot
  ([segno_engine_api.h:167](../../packages/segno_engine/src/core/segno_engine_api.h)).
  Real plugins expose arbitrary param counts, plain (non-normalized) ranges, and an
  **opaque state blob** beyond exposed params.
- `TrackEffect` is `{type, List<double> params}` with **no place for opaque state,
  plugin identity, or a variable-length param list**
  ([track_effect.dart:117](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/models/track_effect.dart)).
- Type changes reset DSP state cheaply on the audio thread
  ([engine_process.c](../../packages/segno_engine/src/core/engine_process.c)); a
  plugin **cannot** be created/destroyed/`prepare`d on the audio callback.
- `fromCode` silently falls back to `none`
  ([track_effect.dart:84](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/models/track_effect.dart))
  — acceptable for a built-in, **data loss** for a user's plugin.
- The chain is hardcoded **stereo** (`fx_apply_chain(... float* l, float* r ...)`).
- No `le_plugin_scan` ABI exists; no native-window plumbing exists.

This feature grafts an **unbounded, stateful, crash-prone, possibly-RT-violating**
object onto that model. Nearly every design decision below is a consequence of that
mismatch.

## Proposed Solution

A new **in-process host module** (C++ behind a C ABI) sits under the engine. A
single `LE_FX_PLUGIN` vtable row dispatches the audio callback into a live plugin
instance owned by a per-slot host handle. Loading, scanning, param enumeration,
native windows, and state (de)serialization all happen on the **control/main
thread**; only `process` runs on the audio thread. A new ABI section
(`le_plugin_*`) exposes scanning, instancing, dynamic params, native windows, and
state to the Dart FFI layer. The Dart/repository/UI layers gain a plugin-aware
extension of `TrackEffect` and a plugin browser.

### Architecture (chosen: A — in-process host behind the FX vtable)

```

**Why A.** Smallest delta to the current architecture; fastest path to a plugin
making sound. It follows the grain of everything already in the engine (hand-rolled
C core, miniaudio, hand-authored FFI). Out-of-process sandboxing (B) is rejected for
MVP on upfront cost; JUCE (C) is rejected on licensing (GPLv3) + fit. (Full
rationale in the brainstorm.)

### The `IPluginHost` abstraction (C++)

One format-agnostic interface with per-format backends, behind a C ABI so Dart FFI
and the C engine never see C++ types:

```cpp
// packages/segno_engine/src/host/plugin_host.h  (C++ internal)
struct PluginDescriptor { std::string id, name, vendor; PluginFormat fmt; std::string path; };
struct ParamInfo { uint32_t id; std::string name, unit; double min, max, def;
                   int32_t stepCount; uint32_t flags; };

class IPluginHost {                       // one instance per loaded plugin slot
 public:
  virtual bool   load(const PluginDescriptor&, double sr, int maxBlock) = 0;  // main
  virtual void   activate() = 0;          // main; allocate, ready-but-bypassed
  virtual void   process(float* l, float* r, int n) = 0;  // AUDIO THREAD ONLY
  virtual int    paramCount() = 0;        // main
  virtual ParamInfo paramInfo(int idx) = 0;               // main
  virtual double paramGet(uint32_t id) = 0;               // main
  virtual void   paramSetQueued(uint32_t id, double plain) = 0; // thread-safe -> RT queue
  virtual bool   openEditor(void* parentNativeView) = 0;  // main
  virtual void   closeEditor() = 0;       // main
  virtual std::vector<uint8_t> saveState() = 0;           // main, opaque blob
  virtual bool   loadState(const uint8_t*, size_t) = 0;   // main
  virtual ~IPluginHost() = default;
};
// VST3Host : IPluginHost   — IComponent/IAudioProcessor/IEditController/IPlugView
// ClapHost : IPluginHost    — clap_plugin + params/gui/state extensions
```

Param-change flow is **never a direct store from the audio thread** (both SDKs
forbid it). `paramSetQueued` pushes onto a lock-free SPSC ring; the host drains it
at the top of `process()` into the SDK's native event/queue mechanism
(VST3 `IParameterChanges`, CLAP `clap_input_events`). Inbound changes (user turns a
knob in the native window) are drained from the SDK's output events / read back on a
low-rate main-thread poll and reconciled into app state — see [D-SYNC](#decisions).

### New C ABI surface (`le_plugin_*`)

Mirrors the existing `le_engine_*` style (opaque handles, `int32_t` result codes,
`out`-param structs, fixed-size char buffers for FFI). **No varargs** — every
per-slot call takes a concrete **opaque `le_plugin_slot*` handle** returned when the
plugin is loaded into a slot. This resolves the addressing question up front (review
finding C1/VGV) so ffigen binds clean signatures and dependent PRs inherit a stable
ABI. New header section in
[segno_engine_api.h](../../packages/segno_engine/src/core/segno_engine_api.h):

```c
/* ---- Scanning (main thread; runs on a dedicated scan thread, see below) ---- */
typedef enum le_plugin_format { LE_PLUGIN_VST3 = 0, LE_PLUGIN_CLAP = 1 } le_plugin_format;

typedef struct le_plugin_desc {

} le_plugin_desc;

/* le_plugin_scan_begin spawns ONE dedicated OS scan thread (the engine has no pool);

LE_EXPORT int32_t le_engine_set_lane_plugin(le_engine*, int32_t channel, int32_t lane,
                                            int32_t slot, const char* plugin_id,

  double   min, max, def; int32_t step_count; uint32_t flags; /* automatable/readonly/bypass/hidden/stepped */

LE_EXPORT int32_t le_plugin_state_set(le_plugin_slot*, const uint8_t* buf, int32_t bytes);
```

> `kPluginKnobs` (the first-N cutoff, D-UI) is a **Dart UI-layer** constant, not an
> ABI concern: `le_plugin_param_count`/`_info_at` always return the full list and the
> card decides how many to render (review finding N1).

A new `LE_FX_PLUGIN` enum value is added to `le_fx_type`, with a vtable row whose
`process` forwards to the slot's `IPluginHost::process` and whose `defaults` is a
no-op (params come from the plugin, not a fixed table). `fx_apply_chain` gains a
plugin branch that calls the host and then **sanitizes** the output
(`flush-denormals + NaN/Inf -> 0`) before it re-enters the chain.

### Plugin-slot lifecycle (cross-thread)

This is the heart of [D-LIFE](#decisions). The audio thread must never load/free a
plugin; it only ever reads an atomically-published "ready" flag.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Empty
    Empty --> Loading: set_lane_plugin (control thread)
    Loading --> Ready: load+activate ok, atomic publish
    Loading --> Failed: load error / unsupported topology
    Ready --> Unloading: remove / replace (control thread)
    Unloading --> Empty: audio thread stopped calling, then destroy
    Failed --> Empty: surfaced to UI, slot cleared
    note right of Loading
      Audio thread renders DRY PASSTHROUGH
      for this slot (no click) until Ready.
    end note
    note right of Unloading
      Audio thread stops calling process();
      control thread destroys after a
      published-quiescent handshake.
    end note
```

## Decisions

These resolve the brainstorm's Open Questions and the flow analysis's "DECISION
NEEDED" items.

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|-------|----------|
| **D-P1** | Plugin in snapshot-copied monitor chain (the dry-recording hotspot, `_snapshotMonitorChainsOntoLanes` [looper_repository.dart:511](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/looper_repository.dart)) | Today this is a pure Dart by-value `List.of` copy. With plugins it must, **at record-stop**, call `le_plugin_state_get` (control thread) on the monitor slot and store the returned **opaque blob** on each recording lane's `PluginEffect`. On playback the lane **lazily instantiates a distinct *frozen* host** from that blob — a separate `IPluginHost` from the live monitor host, created at first lane playback and destroyed on take-delete (not pooled). If blob capture **fails** (plugin mid-load / `state_get` error), the lane entry falls back to **bypassed** and the capture error is surfaced; the captured **audio is byte-identical dry regardless** (the invariant does not depend on capture success). (Q1: lane + monitor, blob snapshot.) |
| **D-LIFE** | Cross-thread slot lifecycle | Control-thread **load → activate (bypassed) → atomic publish "ready"**; audio thread renders **dry passthrough** until ready and after unload is requested. Destroy happens control-thread-side after a published-quiescent handshake. **No** alloc/lock/dylib-load on the audio thread. |
| **D-RT** | RT-safety boundary | Plugin slots are **explicitly RT-exempt** ("best effort"): a stalling plugin can xrun the whole device callback and desync the master clock — **documented blast radius**, no watchdog in MVP. Output is **sanitized** (denormal flush + NaN/Inf→0) at the slot boundary so a misbehaving plugin can't poison downstream lanes or the master sum. (Q3.) |
| **D-PARAM** | Dynamic params vs fixed 4-float | Plugins carry a **variable-length** param list sourced live from the plugin; built-in effects keep their fixed 4-float surface unchanged. `le_plugin_param_*` is a **separate ABI section** — `LE_FX_PARAMS` is *not* widened. Param sets are **queued** into the SDK event mechanism, never stored from the audio thread. |
| **D-SYNC** | Two-way param/state sync (native window ↔ app) | App→plugin: queued param set. Plugin→app: re-read **full state on editor-close and on session-save**; a low-rate (≤10 Hz) main-thread poll mirrors the first-N knob values while an editor is open. On conflict, **the plugin is the source of truth**. **Sequencing:** the editor-close/save state re-read must run **after** the RT param queue is drained, never concurrently, or a just-queued in-app knob change is clobbered by the re-read. The poll **timer is owned by `LooperBloc` and cancelled on close** (no leaked timer). |
| **D-UI** | In-app knob surface | Card shows the first `kPluginKnobs` (=4) **automatable, non-hidden** params as knobs + **Open Editor**. A 0-param plugin shows name + bypass + Open Editor only. (Q2.) |
| **D-MISS** | Missing/moved/version-drift plugin on reload | Render a **placeholder/disabled slot** that **preserves the opaque blob + plugin ref** and shows "Plugin X unavailable" (relinkable later). The `none` silent-fallback **must not** apply to plugin entries. Identity = `format + id (+ version)`; same-id/different-version relinks with a "version changed" note. |
| **D-WIN** | Native window ownership | Host owns a **top-level OS window** (NSWindow / HWND / X11), *not* embedded in the Flutter tree (sidesteps the child-window limitation PROGRESS.md flags). Closing the owning **slot / lane / track / session** force-closes its editor; **app quit** closes all editors. Removing a plugin whose editor is open force-closes the window first. |
| **D-SCAN** | Scanning | **Async** control-thread scan with progress + cancel; **never** blocks the audio callback. Results cached keyed by **(path, mtime, size)** so a reinstalled/updated plugin re-scans; cache invalidated on app-version bump. A single broken plugin is caught per-candidate (try + timeout) → a "failed to scan" entry, **not** an aborted scan. (Out-of-process scan isolation is a named follow-up if in-process crashes prove common.) |
| **D-BUS** | Topology guard | MVP accepts **stereo-in/stereo-out effect** plugins only; **mono→stereo** is adapted (duplicate L→R). Instruments (no audio-in), multi-bus, and sidechain plugins are **rejected at insert** with a localized message; no partial slot is created. |
| **D-LICENSE** | Vendoring posture | Vendor VST3 SDK (MIT, 3.8+) + CLAP headers (MIT) under `third_party/`. Both MIT → clean for the MIT engine core. Windows is **already GPLv3** via the vendored ASIO SDK ([third_party/asiosdk](../../packages/segno_engine/third_party)); VST3/CLAP being MIT **does not worsen** that — documented in `third_party/README.md`. |

## Data Model

`TrackEffect` becomes a **sealed hierarchy** — `BuiltInEffect` (the current
`{type, params:[4]}`) and `PluginEffect` (plugin ref + variable params + opaque
blob) — in **both** the engine model
([track_effect.dart](../../packages/segno_engine/lib/src/track_effect.dart)) and the
repository mirror
([models/track_effect.dart](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/models/track_effect.dart)).
This avoids a half-null god-object (review finding: prefer sealed over nullable
plugin fields bolted onto the built-in class); `props`/`copyWith`/`==` are updated
per variant. The engine model is the source of truth and the repository mirrors it,
exactly as today — **no domain/engine drift**; the engine codec is added first, the
repository delegates to it.

**Wire format: no envelope.** Today `encodeTrackEffects` emits a **bare top-level
JSON array** `[{type,params}]` with no `schemaVersion` — there is no envelope to
bump, and inventing one would itself break every existing key. Instead,
`decodeTrackEffects` **dual-decodes by entry shape**: a built-in entry is unchanged;
a plugin entry is recognized by `type == LE_FX_PLUGIN` carrying a `plugin` key. A
pre-plugin (v1) session is simply an array with no plugin entries and decodes
untouched (back-compat is the presence/absence of the `plugin` key, not a version
field — review finding I1/VGV-critical).

```mermaid
erDiagram
    FX_CHAIN ||--o{ TRACK_EFFECT : contains
    TRACK_EFFECT ||--o| PLUGIN_REF : "when type == plugin"
    PLUGIN_REF ||--o| PLUGIN_STATE : "opaque blob"
    PLUGIN_DESCRIPTOR ||--o{ PLUGIN_REF : "resolved by (format,id)"

    TRACK_EFFECT {
        int type "code; new: plugin"
        float_list params "built-ins: 4 normalized"
    }
    PLUGIN_REF {
        int format "vst3|clap"
        string id "TUID/clap id - stable identity"
        int version "for drift detection"
        float_list paramValues "variable-length, plain"
    }
    PLUGIN_STATE {
        string blobBase64 "opaque preset/patch"
    }
    PLUGIN_DESCRIPTOR {
        string id
        string name
        string vendor
        string path
        int format
    }
```

Wire-format sketch (still a **bare array**, the engine serializer stays the single
source of truth — repository delegates to it):

```jsonc
// Bare top-level array, unchanged container. Built-in entries keep {type, params:[4]}
// and decode untouched; plugin entries are recognized by type == LE_FX_PLUGIN + "plugin".
[
  { "type": 1, "params": [0.5, 0.8, 0, 0] },              // built-in drive (unchanged)
  { "type": 8,                                            // LE_FX_PLUGIN
    "plugin": { "format": 0, "id": "56535444...", "version": 10203 },
    "paramValues": [0.7, 0.2, 1.0],                       // variable length, plain
    "state": "BASE64==" }                                 // opaque blob, optional
]
```

Files that change for the model:
[track_effect.dart](../../packages/segno_engine/lib/src/track_effect.dart) (engine
serializer + new `LE_FX_PLUGIN` code),
[models/track_effect.dart](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/models/track_effect.dart)
(domain mirror + plugin ref/state; `fromCode` must **not** silent-drop plugin codes),
[looper_repository.dart](../../packages/looper_repository/lib/src/looper_repository.dart)
(`_snapshotMonitorChainsOntoLanes` blob capture for D-P1),
[settings_repository.dart](../../packages/settings_repository/lib/src/settings_repository.dart)
(blob-bearing persistence; the existing per-`(channel,lane)`/`input` string values
now hold base64 blobs — confirm the key scheme holds the larger payloads + add a
round-trip test).

## State Management & Engine Boundary

The repo drives every FX edit through **typed `LooperBloc` events**
([looper_event.dart](../../lib/looper/bloc/looper_event.dart)) and
`_pushLaneEffects`/`_pushMonitorEffects` — there is **no separate FX cubit** (the
architecture diagram's "FX bloc / cubit" box is the existing `LooperBloc`; do not add
a redundant state unit). The existing `LooperLaneEffectParamChanged` carries
`param: int (0..kTrackEffectParams-1)` + `value: 0..1` and **cannot** be reused for
plugins (params are a `uint32 id` with a *plain* range). This feature adds:

- **New `LooperBloc` events** (and monitor equivalents): `LooperLanePluginInserted`
  (channel, lane, slot, pluginId), `LooperLanePluginParamChanged` (slot, paramId,
  plainValue), `LooperLanePluginEditorOpened` / `…Closed`, `LooperLanePluginRelinked`
  (for D-MISS placeholders). UI **dispatches events** — no business logic / FFI calls
  in widgets (VGV).
- **Engine boundary is the `AudioEngine` interface, not `NativeAudioEngine`
  directly.** The boundary is `abstract interface class AudioEngine`
  ([audio_engine.dart](../../packages/segno_engine/lib/src/audio_engine.dart)) split
  into capability interfaces (`EngineLifecycle`/`EngineRouting`/…) with
  `NativeAudioEngine` and **`MockAudioEngine`** implementations. Plugin calls land on
  a **new `EnginePluginHosting` capability interface**, mirroring that segregation.
- **`MockAudioEngine` parity is mandatory.** Every `le_plugin_*` capability must be
  stubbed in
  [mock_audio_engine.dart](../../packages/segno_engine/lib/src/mock_audio_engine.dart)
  with deterministic fakes (fixed scan list, fake param enumeration, no-op editor) or
  `flutter test` goes red app-wide. This is per-PR, not deferred.
- **Localized strings (ARB, en + es).** New user-facing keys: `pluginScanProgress`
  (`{found}`/`{total}` placeholders), `pluginScanFailedEntry`, `pluginLoadFailed`,
  `pluginUnsupportedTopology` (D-BUS reject), `pluginUnavailable` (D-MISS),
  `pluginVersionChanged`, `pluginWaylandUnsupported`. Added to **both** `app_en.arb`
  and `app_es.arb` with `@`-metadata.
- **UI widget discipline.** The plugin card is its own extracted widget class
  (e.g. `_PluginDeviceCard`, sibling to the existing `_DeviceCard`/`_DraggableDevice`
  in [signal_fx_rack.dart](../../lib/looper/view/signal_graph/signal_fx_rack.dart)) —
  not a `_build` method — resolving sizing/colors from the existing `LooperTheme`
  `ThemeExtension`s ([signal_style.dart](../../lib/looper/view/signal_graph/signal_style.dart)),
  no pixel params in its public API.

## PR Sequence

A stacked multi-PR effort. Each PR is independently mergeable and leaves the tree
green (macOS, incl. `MockAudioEngine` stubs) unless explicitly noted. The split
below is the **9-PR decomposition from the plan-splitting review** — it separates the
build-wiring churn (vendoring) from logic, gives the safety-critical cross-thread
**lifecycle state machine its own focused PR**, and surfaces the domain-model + the
`fromCode` silent-drop fix as an explicit gate. To be formalized into `-part-N`
files by `/plan-technical-review`.

## Edge Cases

**Scanning** — 0 plugins found (empty state); plugin crashes/times out during scan
(per-candidate guard → "failed to scan" entry, scan continues); cache stale after
reinstall/update (re-scan via mtime/size key); scan while audio running (must not
block callback); rescan mid-scan; duplicate plugin id in two paths (**first wins**,
where "first" = scan order: user paths before system paths, then lexicographic by
path).

**Insert** — load failure (clear message, no slot created); slow load (async,
spinner, cancelable); mono-only adapted L→R; instrument / multi-bus / wrong channel
count rejected (D-BUS); insert into a full 8-deep chain (rejected as today); same
plugin inserted twice (two independent instances + two editor windows).

**Params** — 0-param plugin (card = name + bypass + Open Editor); 200-param plugin
(only first-N knobs in-app, rest in native window); param changed in native window
reflects in app (D-SYNC poll/close); app knob reflects in native window; output
NaN/denormal sanitized (D-RT).

**Editor window** — open/close; multiple editors open at once; close
session/track/lane while editor open (force-close); quit app with editors open
(close all); remove plugin while editor open (force-close first); multi-monitor
placement; focus stealing; window must never outlive its plugin instance.

**Persistence** — save+reload with plugin present; plugin uninstalled / moved /
version-drift on reload (placeholder preserves blob, relinkable — D-MISS); huge
state blob restore (async, slot bypassed until ready); corrupt/garbage blob (safe
fallback, slot disabled, no crash); pre-plugin (schema v1) session still decodes;
**dry-recording invariant**: the captured take is plugin-free; the plugin only
colors playback (D-P1).

**RT** — plugin allocates/locks/stalls on the callback (documented xrun blast
radius, D-RT); plugin emits NaN/Inf (sanitized); remove plugin slot while audio runs
(no use-after-free, D-LIFE); reorder a chain containing a plugin mid-stream; plugin
crash mid-callback (in-process ⇒ documented app crash; autosave is a follow-up).

**Cross-platform** — macOS session opened on Linux where the plugin has no build
(placeholder, D-MISS); X11 vs Wayland editor (X11 only MVP); Windows registry scan
vs macOS bundle scan; GPLv3-on-Windows posture unchanged by MIT VST3/CLAP
(D-LICENSE).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Dry invariant.** A take recorded with a plugin in the (lane or
  snapshot-copied monitor) chain produces a captured buffer **byte-identical** to
  the same take with the plugin bypassed — the plugin affects playback color only.
  *(Automated engine test.)*
- [ ] **Output safety.** Plugin-slot output is denormal-flushed and NaN/Inf→0
  sanitized before re-entering the chain; a deliberately NaN-emitting test plugin
  cannot poison downstream lanes or the master sum. *(Engine test.)*
- [ ] **Lifecycle safety.** Insert/remove/reorder a plugin slot while audio runs
  causes **no use-after-free** and **no audio-thread allocation**; the audio thread
  renders dry passthrough (no click) during load/unload. *(Native test harness;
  ASan if available.)*
- [ ] **Missing-plugin resilience.** Reloading a session whose plugin is
  uninstalled yields a placeholder slot that preserves the opaque blob and is
  relinkable; the rest of the session loads; **no silent data loss.**
- [ ] **Window teardown.** Closing the owning slot/lane/track/session, and quitting
  the app, closes all child editor windows with **zero leaked native windows.**
- [ ] **Two-way param sync.** A param change in the native editor is reflected in
  app state and persisted on editor-close/session-save; an app knob change is
  reflected in the native editor.
- [ ] **Topology guard.** Inserting an unsupported plugin (instrument / multi-bus /
  wrong channel count) is rejected at insert with a localized message; no partial
  slot is created.
- [ ] **Scan robustness.** Scan reports progress, is cancelable, does not block the
  audio callback, caches by (path, mtime, size), and a single broken plugin neither
  aborts the scan nor crashes the app.
- [ ] **Format parity.** Every behavior above holds for **both** VST3 and CLAP
  (proven against one known plugin of each format on macOS).
- [ ] **Back-compat.** A pre-plugin (schema v1) session decodes unchanged.

## Testing Strategy

- **Engine (C/C++).** Extend the existing native CHECK/printf + `main()`-registered
  harness (see the test-runner gotcha in project memory — broken very_good MCP test,
  use the absolute flutter path; hand-authored FFI plugin). New tests: sanitize
  (NaN/denormal in → clean out), dry-invariant byte-compare, lifecycle (insert/remove
  under a simulated running callback), param-queue ordering. A tiny **stub plugin**
  (a hand-written minimal VST3 + CLAP that exposes 2 params, opaque state, and an
  optional NaN-emit mode) is the test fixture so CI needs no third-party install.
- **Dart (repository/model).** Sealed `TrackEffect` plugin round-trip
  (encode/decode, blob base64, **dual-decode**: the exact current bare-array string
  still decodes; plugin entry recognized by `type+plugin`), missing-plugin
  placeholder, `PluginCatalog` scan-cache keying, **D-P1 snapshot blob capture +
  capture-failure fallback**, `settings_repository` blob-bearing round-trip.
  `mocktail` for the engine boundary; `MockAudioEngine` deterministic fakes.
- **Bloc (`bloc_test`).** Each new `LooperBloc` plugin event — insert
  success/failure, plugin-param-set (queued), missing-plugin relink, editor
  open/close — seeded from realistic initial states. (A new state unit without a
  test is a VGV fail.)
- **Widget.** `_PluginDeviceCard` renders first-N knobs / 0-param layout /
  placeholder state; Open Editor wiring; topology-reject message; theme-token
  styling. Golden where the card design matters.
- **Manual (per platform PR).** Scan → insert → tweak → open editor → save → reload
  with a real plugin of each format; kill-the-plugin and missing-on-reload paths.
- **ffigen.** After every ABI change run `dart format` on the generated bindings
  (ffigen short-style drift — documented in project memory + `ffigen.yaml`).

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| In-process plugin crash takes down Segno | Documented (D-RT); autosave-on-crash + out-of-process sandbox are named follow-ups. |
| Audio-thread stall desyncs master clock | Documented blast radius; sanitize bounds *value* corruption; watchdog deferred. |
| SDK build wiring (SPM macOS, CMake Win/Linux) churn | PR1 isolates vendoring + build; header-only/glob patterns per existing engine layout; `dart format` after ffigen. |
| Linux GUI embedding least standardized; many plugins ship no Linux build | PR7 confirms expectations first; X11 only, Wayland editors unsupported with a message; missing-build → placeholder. |
| `LE_FX_PARAMS=4` assumptions leak into plugin path | Plugins use a **separate** `le_plugin_param_*` section; `LE_FX_PARAMS` untouched; built-in path unchanged. |
| Schema migration breaks old sessions | `schemaVersion` + explicit v1 decode test; built-in entries unchanged on the wire. |

## Out of Scope

- Exporting Segno's engine **as** a VST3/CLAP plugin (inverse direction) — separate
  brainstorm.
- Instrument plugins, MIDI-driven plugins, multi-bus / sidechain topologies.
- Out-of-process sandboxing (architecture B), stall watchdog, out-of-process scan
  isolation, autosave-on-crash — named **future hardening** phase.
- Plugin preset *browser* (factory presets beyond opaque state round-trip).
- Parameter automation/recording of plugin params over the loop timeline.
