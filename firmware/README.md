# segno foot-pedal firmware

A **pure thin client** for the segno bidirectional MIDI looper pedal. It holds
no looper state: it renders its LEDs only from the state frames segno pushes and
sends raw footswitch / encoder events. segno runs the behavior state machine and
is the single source of truth — see
[`docs/plan/2026-06-14-feat-looper-pedal-protocol-firmware-plan.md`](../docs/plan/2026-06-14-feat-looper-pedal-protocol-firmware-plan.md).

```
segno ── SysEx state frames + loop-top pulse (0xFA) ──▶ pedal renders LEDs
pedal ── Notes (footswitches) + relative CC (encoder) ──▶ segno runs the machine
```

## Layout

| file | purpose |
|------|---------|
| `segno_pedal/segno_pedal.ino` | the Arduino UNO sketch (thin client) |
| `segno_pedal/pedal_protocol.h` / `.c` | the SysEx codec — the shared wire contract |
| `test/test_pedal_protocol.c` | host-compiled contract test vs the golden fixtures |

`pedal_protocol.c` is the **exact same** wire format as segno's Dart
`PedalCodec` (`packages/pedal_repository`). The host test below links that unit
and checks it against the committed golden `.syx` fixtures segno generated, so
both sides are guaranteed to agree byte-for-byte.

## Building the sketch

Requires the [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library and the
Arduino UNO toolchain (`arduino-cli` or the IDE). The Arduino build compiles
every `.c`/`.cpp`/`.ino` in the sketch folder, so `pedal_protocol.c` is picked up
automatically.

```sh
arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno firmware/segno_pedal
arduino-cli upload  --fqbn arduino:avr:uno -p <PORT> firmware/segno_pedal
```

**Upload first, flash MIDI second:** the sketch is uploaded over the stock
USB-serial firmware. Only *after* the sketch is on the board do you reflash the
16U2 to dualMocoLUFA (below) to turn the USB port into a class-compliant MIDI
device. To upload a new sketch later, flash the **stock** Arduino USB-serial
firmware back onto the 16U2 first.

## USB-MIDI via dualMocoLUFA (the 16U2)

The UNO's ATmega16U2 normally presents a USB-serial port. The
[dualMocoLUFA](https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa) firmware makes it a
**USB-MIDI** device that bridges to the ATmega328P's hardware serial at 31250
baud — which is why the sketch uses `Serial.begin(31250)` and the MIDIUSB library
is **not** usable here (it is 32U4-only).

Stock dualMocoLUFA enumerates as USB product "MocoLUFA". We build from source
with [`mocolufa-segno-rename.patch`](mocolufa-segno-rename.patch) applied, which
renames the USB-MIDI product string to "Segno Loopstation":

```sh
# one-time build setup
git clone https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa
curl -LO http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/files/LUFA/LUFA-100807.zip
unzip LUFA-100807.zip -d mocolufa/../  # unpacks alongside mocolufa/, per makefile's LUFA_PATH
cd mocolufa
patch -p1 < /path/to/firmware/mocolufa-segno-rename.patch
make clean && make   # produces dualMoco.hex
```

Put the 16U2 in DFU mode (briefly short the 16U2 RESET pin to GND — the two pads
near the USB connector), then:

```sh
# erase, flash the patched dualMoco.hex, restart
dfu-programmer atmega16u2 erase
dfu-programmer atmega16u2 flash dualMoco.hex
dfu-programmer atmega16u2 reset
```

dualMocoLUFA boots in MIDI mode by default; hold the mode jumper (see its README)
at power-on to fall back to serial mode for re-uploading the sketch.

## Pin map & LED order

Set in `segno_pedal.ino` to match the original "aquiles LoopStation" wiring
(verified on hardware).

**LEDs** — a single `WS2812B` strip on pin `D2`, 19 LEDs:

| index | role |
|-------|------|
| 0–11 | the 12-LED loop-position ring (fixed-cadence decorative sweep, ~700 ms/revolution; not currently synced to loop length) |
| 12 | global / mode color |
| 13–16 | the active bank's 4 track indicators (Tr1–Tr4) |
| 17 | clear-fade indicator |
| 18 | bank indicator (lit for bank B) |

**Footswitches** — active-low (`INPUT_PULLUP`), one note each (matching
`PedalButton`):

| pin | button | note |
|-----|--------|------|
| D3 | Rec/Play | 0 |
| D4 | Stop | 1 |
| D5 | Undo | 2 |
| D6 | Mode | 3 |
| D7 | Track 1 | 4 |
| D8 | Track 2 | 5 |
| D9 | Track 3 | 6 |
| D10 | Track 4 | 7 |
| D11 | Clear | 8 |
| D12 | Bank | 9 |

**Encoder** — quadrature on `A0` (clock) / `A1` (data), sends relative CC `0x10`
(binary-offset); segno maps it to the master output gain. The original "Next"
switch (`A2`) is dropped in this layout.

## Contract test (host, no board)

The firmware's codec is unit-tested on the host against segno's golden
fixtures. The shared runner builds and runs the contract test against **both**
in-repo protocol copies (`firmware/segno_pedal/` and
`hardware/firmware/segno_pedal_32u4/`) and fails if the two copies drift —
run it from anywhere (it cd's to the repo root itself):

```sh
bash firmware/test/run_tests.sh
# expected last line: run_tests.sh: both protocol copies pass
```

CI runs the identical script (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`, `native-tests`
job). It decodes every `packages/pedal_repository/test/fixtures/*.syx`,
re-encodes it, and asserts the bytes are identical to the fixture — plus field
decodes, the full v1/v2/v3 version-pairing matrix, the FX→mute downgrade
twins, malformed-frame rejection, the identity request, and the Note/encoder
encoders. On-device behavior (LED rendering, debounce, the FastLED
poll-around-`show()`) is covered by the manual per-OS smoke pass.

## Protocol summary

State frame (segno → pedal), 26 bytes at every version:

```
F0 7D <ver> <type=01> <20 packed payload bytes> <checksum> F7
```

The 17-byte logical payload (flags · global color · bank/mode-high byte ·
armed track · 8 track LEDs · loop length µs · master gain) is 7-bit packed and
XOR-checksummed. The decoder also accepts the legacy 16-byte payload (pre
master-gain), decoding it with unity gain, so an old pedal/app still
interoperates. Loop-top is the single real-time byte `0xFA`. Footswitches send
a fixed Note (NoteOn press / NoteOff release); the encoder sends relative CC
`0x10`. See `pedal_protocol.h` and segno's `PedalCodec` for the authoritative
field table.

Version history — the logical payload is 17 bytes at **all** versions; each
bump only claimed previously-reserved bits:

- **v1** (`<ver>=01`): the baseline. Flags byte bits 4-7 reserved zero; the
  interaction mode is the single flags bit 0 (`0` rec, `1` play).
- **v2** (`<ver>=02`, D11): flags bits 4-6 = looper mode, bit 7 = counting-in.
- **v3** (`<ver>=03`, FX v3 part 5a): the interaction mode widens to 2 bits —
  low bit stays flags bit 0, the high bit is bit 1 of the bank byte (payload
  byte 2) — adding FX mode (`2`); wire value `3` is reserved (rejected).
  Adds the blue chain-enabled track-LED color (index 3). The mode field is
  the only wire-format difference from v2; encoders targeting v1/v2 degrade
  FX mode to play (mute) and blue LEDs to green, since pre-v3 decoders
  reject a frame carrying any unknown enum index wholesale (B10).

`PEDAL_FRAME_MAX_BYTES` is 32, against a 26-byte wire frame today — 6 bytes
of headroom before any output buffer needs to grow.

## D-PEDAL addendum: performance-recording arm/disarm

Adds a **flags bit only** — no new footswitch pin, no new Note, no pin-map
change. The physical pedal has no spare footswitch slot, so the gesture rides
the existing **MODE** button (`D6`, note `3`) instead:

- **Tap MODE** — toggles Rec/Play mode (unchanged).
- **Hold MODE ≥ 500 ms** — arms/disarms performance recording. segno times the
  hold itself from the same press/release Notes the firmware already sends
  (identical to how UNDO's tap-vs-long-press-for-redo already works); the
  firmware does not need to distinguish tap from hold.

The one wire change is **payload byte 0, bit 3** (`performance_armed`),
alongside the existing bit0 (mode) / bit1 (clear fade) / bit2 (goodbye). When
set, **LED 12** (the mode/global-activity LED) blinks red instead of showing
its usual transport-activity color — deliberately distinct from
`PEDAL_GLOBAL_RED`'s **solid** red (looper recording), so the performer can
tell "armed" from "recording" eyes-free. Blink half-period is 400 ms,
matching the on-screen simulator.

**Back-compat:** a pedal still running pre-D-PEDAL firmware never sets bit3,
which decodes as `performance_armed = 0` — segno just never shows the pedal as
armed; nothing else in the frame changes shape. Conversely, new firmware
talking to an old app build is unaffected too, since bit3 was previously
always `0` and simply carried no meaning.
