/// What a pedal binding points at: one whole chain, or one effect inside a
/// chain (A9).
///
/// ## Why this type lives app-side
///
/// The typed target and its resolution sit next to `ControlCubit` rather than
/// in `pedal_repository` / `controller_repository` (VGV-critical): those
/// packages carry bindings as opaque [canonicalString] values and gain NO
/// looper/engine dependency, so no second control-surface interpreter can grow
/// inside a repository package. `ControlCubit` stays the single dispatch point.
///
/// ## Canonical JSON
///
/// The encoding EXTENDS part 3a's [FxAddress] canonical form rather than
/// redeclaring it (R19): the address contributes its own fixed key order
/// (`stage`, `index`, `lane`), and an effect-level target appends exactly one
/// key, `slot`. A chain-level target adds nothing, so its string IS
/// [FxAddress.canonicalString]. Byte-stable in both cases, so plain string
/// equality is target identity.
///
/// This composes safely because [FxAddress.fromJson] ignores keys it does not
/// know (its additive-only contract) — the same map decodes as an address
/// there and as a slot target here.
