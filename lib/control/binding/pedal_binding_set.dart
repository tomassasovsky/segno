/// Bindings on MODE or Bank are DROPPED, not rejected loudly (B12). A

/// overrides the global set WHOLESALE. There is no per-button merging — a
/// session either brings its own complete remap or defers entirely to the
/// globals. Per-button merging was rejected because a half-session/half-global
/// map is a layout no screen can show honestly, and the performer could not
