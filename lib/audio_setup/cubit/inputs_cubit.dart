///
/// Modelled on `TracksCubit` because it is the same problem one level down the
/// signal path: the interface says input 2 and the player says "mic". Two
/// things are NOT copies of it:
///
/// **Names belong to the DEVICE**, not to the socket number. Input 1 on a
/// Scarlett and input 1 on the built-in pair are different jacks with different
/// things plugged into them, and one name for both describes whichever rig was
/// patched last. Keyed off the engine's reported device name, the same shape
/// `latency_offset.$device.$rate.$buffer` already uses.
///
/// **There is no ceiling.** An earlier version stopped at the engine constant
/// now called `LE_MAX_MONITORED_INPUTS`, on the reading that a socket past it
/// was unusable. It caps which inputs the monitor path covers — a
/// higher-numbered channel is still recordable, so it is still worth naming
/// (#558). The list follows whatever the device reports.
///
/// One persisted map and nothing else. Provided at app level and loaded once,
/// because an input is called what the player calls it on every surface that
/// shows one — the Audio face's input chips, the Tracks routing summary and the
/// per-track lane list all read the same names through `l10n.inputName`.
