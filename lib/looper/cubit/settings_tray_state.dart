/// Later parts of the console redesign (#442) each add their own value here

  /// In-tray Signal domain — the four FX stages as tabs of one entry.

  /// **First of the domains**, as the mockups draw the rail: the signal path

  /// that drive it.
  ///
  /// One destination, not four: the tabs are [FxStage] itself — the app's own
  /// FX addressing model, `input · loop · track · master` in signal order — so
  /// this domain does not own a tab enum of its own the way its six siblings
  /// do. A tab here selects which STAGE's chains you are looking at, and every
  /// card on every tab is one chain.
  ///
  /// This is the destination that closed the rail's last exception. Signal was
  /// a tile on the old home face pushing a full-screen route, which #533
  /// replaced
  /// with the face beside the rail.

  /// In-tray Control domain — the footswitch plate and the MIDI foot
  /// controller as tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not two: both tabs answer the same question — *what
  /// outside this box is driving it?* — and they had been in two different
  /// places, one a rail entry of its own (#440) and the other a group buried
  /// in the Settings scroll. Which one is showing is
  /// [SettingsTrayState.controlTab], not a destination of its own.

  /// In-tray Loop domain — the tempo grid, the click and the looper mode as
  /// tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not three: all three tabs answer the same question —
  /// *what governs the loop grid?* — and they had been split between a Loop
  /// rail entry and two groups of the Settings scroll (#518). Which tab is
  /// showing is [SettingsTrayState.loopTab], not a destination of its own.
  loop,

  /// In-tray Tracks domain — names, lengths and routing as tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not three: all three tabs answer the same question —
  /// *what is each track, and where does it go?* — and they had been split
  /// between the Settings scroll's `tracks` section, the Signal domain and, for
  /// the quantize override, nowhere at all (#523).
  ///
  /// The difference from [control] and [loop] is what a ROW means: there a row
  /// is a global setting, here every row on all three tabs is a **track**, and
  /// the engine's own roster drives all three lists. That is why this domain
  /// is the one that needed an empty state — a face whose rows are objects can
  /// have none of them.
  tracks,

  /// In-tray Audio domain — the device, what recording does, and what the
  /// rig is currently doing, as tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not three: all three tabs answer the same question three
  /// ways — what the rig plays through, what pressing record does, and what it
  /// is actually doing right now (#528). They had been one group of the
  /// Settings scroll, `SettingsSection.audio`.
  ///
  /// Status is the tab that makes the split worth having: everything on it is
  /// read-only, because the settings that decide those figures live on Device,
  /// and a figure editable in two places is a figure that disagrees with
  /// itself.
  audio,

  /// In-tray tuner panel. Placement only — the tuner itself is not
  /// implemented, and this face says so.
  tuner,

  /// In-tray Network domain — WiFi and Bluetooth as tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not two: two rail slots for two radios was the same
  /// waste as one Settings bucket for twelve groups (#498). Which radio is
  /// showing is [SettingsTrayState.networkTab], not a destination of its own.
  network,

  /// In-tray System domain — what the screens do, what build is running, what
  /// is on the disk, and what this box is, as tabs of one entry.
  ///
  /// One destination, not four: all four answer the same question — *what is
  /// this console, and how does it behave?* Two of them were groups of the
  /// Settings scroll (`SettingsSection.view` and `.updates`); the other two
  /// had nowhere to live at all, because nothing in the app knew what the
  /// disk held or what the box was called (#530).
