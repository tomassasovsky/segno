/// One chain on the Signal face, as a card: what it is, where it sits, where
/// it goes, what is loaded on it, and whether you hear it.
///
/// **A card-as-tile, which the console vocabulary does not have.** Every other
/// domain draws a list of 70px rows, because on those faces a row is a setting
/// and a setting is a line. Here the thing being drawn is a *chain*, and a
/// chain answers six questions at once — a row would have to pick two of them
/// and bury the rest behind a disclosure. So this stays in the Signal feature
/// until a second domain asks for it, which is the rule `console_surface.dart`
/// has followed since Network.
///
/// The card is 202 wide on the three list tabs and full width on master (one
/// card, so nothing to sit beside). Height is **content-driven**: the mockups
/// draw 196 with a one-line chain summary and 215 with a two-line one, which
/// is one card whose fifth row wraps inside its 166px measure, not two sizes.
///
/// Not interactive yet. Selection, and the panel it opens, are the next PR of
/// this slice; a card that highlighted with nothing to show would be a state
/// with no consequence.
