/// one widget. The stage decides what a card *is* — a socket's monitor chain,
/// a take's playback chain, a track bus, the master insert — and the questions
/// the card answers are the same six either way.
///
/// **Racks are #535, so every card here is rackless.** That is the mockups'

/// worth stating plainly: a card carries its monitor line only when a rack is
/// loaded, so on the loop, track and master tabs no card shows one. The input
/// tab is the decided exception — an input's monitor gate is a fact about the
/// jack rather than about the chain on it, so those cards always show it, and
/// they are what the tri-state actually surfaces until racks land.
