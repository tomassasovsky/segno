/// The Signal domain: the four FX stages of the signal path as four tabs of
/// one rail entry.
///
/// **The tabs are [FxStage] itself.** `fx_address.dart` has declared
/// `input · loop · track · master` since the v3 FX model landed, and the
/// mockups draw four tabs with those four labels in that order. They are the
/// same four things, so this domain is the only one of the seven with no tab
/// enum of its own — a parallel enum would be a second name for one concept,
/// and the one free to drift.
///
/// **This face replaces a full-screen route, not a settings group.** Signal
/// was the last surface the rail deliberately did not carry: a tile on the
/// home face that pushed the old three-pane `signal_graph/` layout
/// away from the stage. The tile is gone as of this PR and the surface itself
/// goes with the last of the slice, which is why the rail no longer documents
/// a route-pushing exception.
///
/// Stateless: the selected stage lives in [SettingsTrayCubit], so leaving and
/// returning to the domain lands where it was left.
