/// **The D4 sequence, and the only implementation of it.** Switching mode with
/// content in the session is rejected by the engine as a SILENT no-op, so this
/// never dispatches into that: it confirms, clears, waits for the bloc to
/// *report* cleared, and only then switches. A second copy of the sequence in
/// the console tray would be a second chance to get the silent no-op subtly
/// wrong, so `LooperModeSection` and the Loop face both call this.

/// non-console screen imports it, so a folder named after one consumer would
/// misstate who owns it.

/// chooser on the way through and leave it open when the confirm was declined
/// — which is what `LOOP / settings-mode-confirm` draws: the mode list is
/// still open behind the dialog.
