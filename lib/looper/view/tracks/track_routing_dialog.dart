/// implements both literally:
///
/// - **Dropping an input sets its own lane to record nothing (`-1`) and leaves
///   the lane where it is.** It does not compact the list.
/// - **Adding an input reuses such a freed lane before growing the track**,
///   and grows first when there is none, so the engine has allocated the lane
///   before it is routed.
///
/// The alternative — rebuild the lane list as "sorted inputs, one per index" —
/// is the obvious implementation and the one to refuse. Lane 2 holds lane 2's
/// recorded audio; renumbering would silently move a take from one source to
/// another whenever an input was added in the middle of the set. The panel
