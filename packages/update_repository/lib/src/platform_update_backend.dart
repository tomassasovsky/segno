/// Implementations:
///   * appliance (Raspberry Pi) — reads `/etc/segno/build-version`, fetches the
///     channel manifest over HTTPS, stages the signed bundle to the inactive
///     RAUC slot via a privileged helper, and reboots to apply;
///   * desktop (macOS/Windows) — drives Sparkle / WinSparkle;
///   * `UnsupportedPlatformBackend` — the inert fallback where in-app updates
///     are not offered (e.g. a generic dev Linux build).
///
/// The backend deals only in raw data and side effects; the newer-than-current
/// decision lives in `UpdateRepository`.
