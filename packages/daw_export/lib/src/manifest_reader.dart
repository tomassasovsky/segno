/// Reads a finalized performance-recording capture directory's
/// `performance.json` (docs/design/performance-manifest-format.md) and
/// `events.log` (docs/design/performance-event-log-format.md) directly — no
/// import of `performance_repository`/`segno_engine`, matching this
/// package's own-input-model rule — into a [DawProject] whose clips
/// reference the capture's already-rendered stems (`stems/wet/`, falling
/// back to `stems/dry/` for a channel whose wet render failed or hasn't run)
/// and per-lane loop exports (`loops/`), and whose tracks carry automation
/// lanes reconstructed from the raw logged volume/mute gestures (part 10).
///
/// Part 10 additionally resolves each channel's real Segno VST3 device
/// chain from its captured lanes' `armSnapshot`-only `effects`
/// ([resolveDeviceChain], D-CHAIN-SOURCE) and, when a non-empty chain
/// resolves, prefers the `stems/dry/` stem over `stems/wet/` for that
/// channel's arrangement clip (D-WETDRY) — falling all the way back to
/// today's wet-preferred, no-device-chain behavior if the dry stem is
/// unexpectedly missing, never risking a silent double-application of
/// effects.
///
/// ## The four FX stages, and which one a `.als` can carry (FX v3, R20)
///
/// A capture records all four v3 stages — Input (`monitors[]`), Loop
/// (`tracks[].lanes[].effects`), Track (`trackChains[]`) and Master
/// (`masterEffects`) — but only the **Loop** stage is ever rendered into
/// audio: `perf_render`'s wet pass applies the lane chain and nothing else,
/// so `stems/dry/` is dry of every stage and `stems/wet/` carries the Loop
/// chain alone. The bus stages live in the manifest and are **never baked
/// into a stem** — that is the pinned decision, not an omission, and it is
/// what keeps a stem honest as a per-stage, dry-of-downstream source.
///
/// This reader therefore keeps resolving exactly one device chain per
/// channel, from the Loop stage, because that is the stage whose sound the
/// arrangement clip is missing. The Track and Master stages are reported
/// verbatim by `fx_chains.dart` in `fx-chains.txt` instead; a `.als` has no
/// place to put them today (`als_builder.dart` emits no main-track device
/// chain at all), so folding them into a track's device chain here would
/// misattribute a bus effect to one track. That gap is deliberate and
/// documented, not silently papered over.
///
/// Per-chain and per-slot bypass are honored throughout: a lane whose
/// `chainEnabled` is `false` contributes **no** audible effects to
/// resolution, exactly as a lane with no chain at all does, and
/// [resolveDeviceChain] drops individual entries whose `enabled` bit is
/// `false`. Both flags are written only when disabled, so a legacy
/// (pre-FX-v3) manifest — which had no way to bypass anything — reads as
/// fully engaged with no version `switch` needed.
