/// [MidiControllerSource], persists the selection, and supervises hotplug
/// lost/restored transitions (diffed per poll tick). The projected
/// [MidiConnection] domain model is published on [connections]; the raw
/// (pre-mapping) input is republished on [activity]. Commands ([select],
/// [selectNone], [refresh]) drive the lifecycle.

/// The `source` is nullable so a build with no MIDI backend (or a test/mock
/// where the native library is absent) degrades gracefully: the picker shows an
/// empty state and selection is a no-op, rather than crashing the app.
