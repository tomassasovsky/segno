/*
 * host_harness.h — golden-parity audio-diff harness (umbrella D-VALIDATE,
 * part 4 of the VST3 pilot).
 *
 * Proves the built VST3 plugins produce the SAME samples as calling
 * engine_fx.c's fx_apply_chain directly, not just "structurally similar."
 * Loads a plugin's factory (GetPluginFactory -> createInstance ->
 * IComponent::initialize/setActive -> IAudioProcessor::process, no
 * windowing, no editor, no scanning), drives it through a fixed signal
 * matrix, and diffs its output against a direct fx_apply_chain call over
 * the identical input/params. Both paths call the exact same compiled
 * fx_apply_chain with no intervening math, so this is verified to be
 * effectively bit-exact in practice (tolerance 1e-6f) — not the looser
 * 1e-4f perf_render.c's golden master-parity test uses for its structurally
 * different, legitimately noisier live-vs-offline-reconstruction
 * comparison; reusing that number here would have hidden a real
 * small-magnitude bug this harness exists to catch.
 *
 * WHY NOT the existing host/slot.cpp + host_vst3.cpp hosting stack: that
 * stack's job is loading arbitrary THIRD-PARTY plugins with a "best effort"
 * runtime contract (D-LIFE's dry-passthrough-on-failure posture, adapter
 * buffering, etc.) — it is deliberately forgiving of imperfect plugins. This
 * harness's job is the opposite: a precision diff against a known-exact
 * reference, for a plugin we wrote and control completely. Reusing the
 * hosting stack would route through machinery (the sample/block adapter,
 * the ready/not-ready state machine) that exists specifically to tolerate
 * the imprecision this harness needs to detect — the wrong tool for this
 * job, not an oversight.
 *
 * WHY NOT dlopen() the built .vst3 bundle: the DSP-parity claim this part
 * makes ("routing audio through the built .vst3 produces the same samples")
 * is about the compiled processor.cpp/engine_fx.c code path, not the bundle
 * packaging step (Info.plist, codesign, .vst3 folder layout) — that's
 * already proven separately by parts 2/3's own CMake build acceptance
 * criteria. Linking factory.cpp/processor.cpp directly into this harness
 * (per-plugin, in its own binary — see test_delay_parity.cpp /
 * test_reverb_parity.cpp) compiles and links the exact same source a
 * dlopen'd bundle would run, without adding a CMake dependency to the
 * otherwise CMake-independent run_native_tests.sh harness — though it is
 * NOT guaranteed to produce byte-identical machine code to a Release-flag
 * CMake build (this harness compiles ad hoc via run_native_tests.sh's own
 * flags, not vst3/CMakeLists.txt's), so it proves DSP-algorithm parity, not
 * bitwise-identical codegen; the 1e-6f tolerance above accommodates that
 * gap without being loose enough to hide a real bug. Two plugins'
 * factory.cpp each define a global (non-namespaced) GetPluginFactory() via
 * the SDK's BEGIN_FACTORY macro, so they cannot be linked into the same
 * binary anyway — one binary per plugin is required either way.
 *
 * KNOWN BLIND SPOT: every signal in the matrix is mono (l == r fed to both
 * channels), matching the umbrella's specific DSP-parity requirement (a
 * mono source through the stereo-bus wrapper must match engine_fx.c's own
 * mono-seeds-l-equals-r convention, engine_private.h). Because the direct
 * fx_apply_chain reference is symmetric under mono input, a channel-
 * crossing bug in the wrapper (e.g. writing L's result into the R output
 * buffer) would be invisible to the mono matrix alone — runChannelCrossCheck
 * (host_harness.cpp) closes this gap with one genuinely asymmetric
 * L-impulse/R-silence case per plugin.
 *
 * VARIABLE PARAM WIDTH (part 6): originally hardcoded to exactly 3 params
 * (fine for Delay/Reverb/Echo, parts 2/3/5). Widened here to
 * ParityConfig::paramCount (<= LE_FX_PARAMS, engine_fx.h's own per-slot
 * param-array width) so Drive/Filter/Tremolo (2 params, parts 6-8) and
 * Octaver (4 params, part 9) fit without a second widening. ParamSpec::params
 * and ParamCombo::values are sized to LE_FX_PARAMS (the true upper bound —
 * one array per engine chain slot); runHosted/runDirect (host_harness.cpp)
 * only ever read the first `paramCount` entries, so a config that leaves
 * `paramCount` at its default (below) can omit the rest without them being
 * touched.
