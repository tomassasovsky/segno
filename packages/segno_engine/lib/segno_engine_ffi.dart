/// Most consumers should depend on the typed `segno_engine.dart` API and its

/// sibling packages that drive a native seam directly — currently
/// `midi_client`, which opens the MIDI capture surface (`le_midi_*`) over the
/// generated `SegnoEngineBindings`.
///
/// Importing this from another package is intentional and avoids reaching into
/// `segno_engine/src` (which would trip the `implementation_imports` lint).
