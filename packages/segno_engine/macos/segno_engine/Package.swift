// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to
// build this package.
//
// Swift Package Manager manifest for the segno_engine FFI plugin on macOS.
//
// This is a C target with one C++ TU (the VST3/CLAP include-probe): the shared
// engine sources live at the plugin root under ../src and are pulled in via
// forwarder translation units in Sources/segno_engine/ (SPM, like CocoaPods,
// only compiles sources inside the package directory). The engine headers
// co-located in ../src resolve relative to each forwarded source file; the one
// exception, miniaudio.h (which lives in ../src/miniaudio/), is satisfied by a
// forwarder header in the target's include/ directory — SPM adds include/ to
// the header search path, and SPM rejects header search paths that point
// outside the package root. The vendored plugin SDKs are the other exception,
// reached via absolute -I flags computed below.
//
// The product is built as a `.dynamic` library so the engine is loaded as its
// own image at launch: this keeps the FFI-exported symbols (LE_EXPORT =
// visibility("default") + used) off the dead-strip list and resolvable at
// runtime via `DynamicLibrary.process()` from Dart. The hyphenated product name
// is required — Swift Package Manager uses it as the CFBundleIdentifier when
// linked dynamically, which cannot contain underscores.

// Absolute paths to the vendored VST3/CLAP SDK roots, which live at the plugin
// root under ../../third_party — OUTSIDE this SPM package, where SPM's safe
// `headerSearchPath` refuses to point. They are passed to clang as raw `-I`
// flags (see cxxSettings below), and a *relative* `-I` cannot be used: under
// xcodebuild the compiler's working directory is not the package root, and
// Flutter consumes this package through a symlink (macos/Flutter/ephemeral/
// Packages/.packages/segno_engine), so `../..` resolves into the wrong tree.
//
// Deriving the paths from this manifest's own location, with the symlink
// resolved, yields a stable absolute path on any machine/CI without hardcoding.
