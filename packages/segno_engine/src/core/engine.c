/*
 * engine.c — the engine's control-thread core, after the S1 split.
 *
 * What remains here: engine lifecycle (le_engine_create / destroy / configure /
 * start / stop / mark_started), the lane / monitor reset helpers, the shared
 * low-level helpers declared in engine_core.h (le_track_set_len, le_mask_to_channel,
 * valid_channel, le_push), the version / device-name / measure-latency thin
 * wrappers, and the deterministic-test entry points (engine_internal.h).
 *
 * The rest of the original monolith now lives in sibling TUs, all behind the
 * unchanged segno_engine_api.h ABI:
 *   - engine_process.c   the real-time core (le_engine_process, transport state
 *                        machine, apply_command, latency harness) — the one
 *                        audio-thread TU, where the no-alloc/no-lock RT contract
 *                        holds.
 *   - engine_commands.c  control-thread command producers (the FFI setters,
 *                        record/undo machinery, lazy fx/lane allocation).
 *   - engine_fx.c        the effects DSP island (kernels, octaver, reverb, chain).
 *   - engine_devices.c   device discovery, loopback detection, backend selection.
 *   - engine_snapshot.c  published-state snapshots + visualization reads.
 *   - engine_session.c   session export / import / commit.
 *   - engine_convert.c   pure sample-format conversion + ASIO buffer math.
 *
 * Multi-track model (unchanged): a shared master loop clock plus N independent
 * tracks; the first to finish recording defines the master length, and one-level
 * undo stays RT-safe because the pre-overdub snapshot is taken on the calling
 * (Dart) thread (engine_commands.c) so the audio thread only swaps a buffer index.

   * pool[slot] itself naming an unmapped page for the width of the allocation,
   * and a reader that loaded the slot in that window got a pointer that is
   * guaranteed to fault. This closes that window: a reader loading pool[slot]
   * at any instant gets either the old buffer or the new one, both mapped.
   *
   * Be precise about what that does NOT buy, because the difference is a
   * SIGSEGV on the SCHED_FIFO thread. A reader that snapshotted the OLD pointer
   * before the swap and dereferences it after le_rt_free still touches an
   * unmapped page — no store order can help it, and where the old calloc
   * storage gave it stale bytes, an unmapped one kills the process. That case
   * is ruled out by the callers' invariant alone: the track is EMPTY, so
   * nothing dereferences the slot at all (le_prepare_new_capture,
   * le_begin_empty_capture, session import). le_rt_alloc storage makes that
   * invariant load-bearing for CRASH-safety where it used to be load-bearing
   * only for audio quality, so relax a call site on the strength of the
   * ordering below and the result is a hard fault, not a click.
   *
   * The order is not free: holding both buffers means a grow now peaks at
   * old + new rather than max(old, new) — 11.6 MB instead of 5.8 for a lane
   * slot at the appliance's default cap — and cannot reuse the mapping it is
   * about to release, so a regrow under real memory pressure can fail where it
   * used to squeak through. Accepted deliberately: publishing before releasing
   * is the only order that keeps a dangling pool[slot] impossible, the peak is
   * one buffer on a unit with gigabytes spare, and every lazy-grow caller
   * already handles a failed grow. The failure SEMANTICS are unchanged from
   * the free-then-allocate version on purpose — the old buffer is released and
   * the slot left unallocated — so nothing downstream sees a new state.
   *
   * Publication order is pointer-then-cap, the mirror of shrink's: this GROWS,
   * so a reader that pairs the new pointer with the not-yet-updated (smaller,
   * or zero) cap reads a short prefix of a larger buffer and is harmless, while
   * the reverse pairing would over-read. Like shrink's, that is an interleaving

 * holds — a retired undo layer, whose cap-sized buffer would otherwise pin the
 * whole recording cap for the session (see le_handle_retired). A failed
 * allocation keeps the oversized buffer: correct, just not yet reclaimed.
 *
 * Map-new / copy / publish / unmap-old, not realloc: the slot is le_rt_alloc
 * storage now (an mmap on POSIX) and cannot be resized in place. That raises the
 * stakes of getting the order wrong — the old buffer is UNMAPPED at the end, so
 * a reader still holding the old pointer faults, where a realloc'd one merely
 * read stale bytes. Hence: the new buffer is fully populated before anything is
 * published, and the old mapping is torn down only once nothing published
 * points at it.
 *
 * What makes that safe is the INVARIANT, not the store order, and the invariant
 * now carries more weight than it did: a reader that snapshotted the old
 * pointer before the swap dereferences an UNMAPPED page once the copy is
 * published, which no ordering can prevent and which kills the SCHED_FIFO
 * thread rather than feeding it stale audio. What rules that out is that a
 * retired slot is one the audio thread handed back through the evt_ring and can
 * no longer name (engine_process.c's #728 note). The shorter cap is stored
 * before the new
 * pointer only because that is the order in which a plain interleaving stays
 * benign — a reader that has not yet seen the new pointer is bounded by the
 * shorter cap on the old, larger buffer. It is NOT a publication barrier and
 * must not be read as one: pool[] and pool_cap[] are plain non-atomic fields,
 * the audio thread reads them plain and in the opposite order (pointer first —
 * engine_process.c's live-slot snapshot), so on a weakly ordered core either
 * side may still reorder. If the invariant above ever stops holding, the fix is
