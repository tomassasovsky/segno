 * engine_commands.c — control-thread command producers + record/undo machinery.
 *
 * THREAD OWNERSHIP: control thread (the Dart-facing FFI setters). Almost every
 * function here validates its arguments and posts a command into the SPSC ring
 * (le_push) for the audio thread to apply; the exceptions do control-thread work
 * the audio thread is guaranteed not to race — the O(1) undo/redo buffer-index
 * swaps, the shadow-slot supply + retired-layer collection (le_engine_drain_events),
 * the quantize/auto-record arm bookkeeping, and the lazy effect-buffer / lane
 * allocation in le_fx_prepare_entry / le_engine_set_lane_count.
 *
 * Undo layers are captured PER OVERDUB PASS on the audio thread (backup-on-write
 * into a pre-posted shadow slot — see engine_process.c); completed layers come
 * back through the evt_ring and are pushed onto the control-side stacks here.
 * Control mutations follow push-then-mutate: state is only changed after the
 * matching ring command was accepted, so a full ring never desyncs the two sides.
 *
 * Split verbatim out of engine.c (S1) behind the unchanged ABI. Shared helpers
 * (le_push, valid_channel, le_lanes_active, le_lane_reset)
 * come from engine_core.h; the octaver Hann init + PV sizes from engine_fx.h. The
 * matching audio-thread consumers (apply_command + handlers) are in
