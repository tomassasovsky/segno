/*
 * audio_ring.h — single-producer/single-consumer lock-free ring for float audio
 * samples.
 *
 * lockfree_ring.h's le_ring stores fixed-size POD commands — the wrong shape for
 * raw audio. le_audio_ring is the audio counterpart: a flat float buffer with the
 * same wait-free push/pop discipline, but with the producer/consumer roles
 * reversed from le_ring — here the AUDIO thread is the producer (the
 * performance-capture taps in engine_process.c push into it) and the control
 * thread is the consumer (perf_drain.c's background drain thread). push_frame
 * writes `n` contiguous floats as one
 * all-or-nothing unit so a stereo/mono capture frame is never torn across a
 * fill/drop boundary: on a full ring it drops the whole frame and returns 0
 * rather than partially writing it.
