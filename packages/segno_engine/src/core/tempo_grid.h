/*
 * tempo_grid.h — pure-value musical-grid math over {bpm, ts_num, ts_den,
 * sample_rate}.
 *
 * Pure value logic (no atomics, no allocation, no engine state): the audio
 * thread computes beat/bar/subdivision geometry from a stack copy of the
 * published tempo state, and the control thread / tests call the same
 * functions with plain values. Mirrors loop_clock.h in spirit: small,
 * self-contained, unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * BEAT UNIT: the beat is the TIME-SIGNATURE DENOMINATOR NOTE (in 7/8 the grid
 * runs on eighth notes; BPM counts denominator notes per minute). The
 * denominator therefore cancels out of frames-per-beat-unit and frames-per-bar
 * and only enters the absolute note-value subdivisions (1/2 .. 1/16 note).
 * Sheeran Looper X semantics, per the plan's D1/D7 (index Architecture §1).
