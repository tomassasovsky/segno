 * table capped at 64 would stop memoising partway through the second direction

 *  - alsa_only (appliance): ALSA cards, unchanged — the open is pinned to the

 *  - libjack present: JACK enumeration; the open lands on JACK and the ids are
 *    JACK node names. (If JACK then declines at runtime — server down, no
 *    ports — the seam returns 0 and miniaudio takes it, as before #649.)
 *  - no libjack, libpulse present: decline to miniaudio — its default probe
 *    order reaches Pulse, the open also lands on Pulse, ids match, and Pulse
 *    enumeration has none of the ALSA hint-clutter pathology.
 *  - NEITHER library (#649): ALSA cards. This is the only configuration whose
 *    device opens on the ALSA backend without SEGNO_ALSA_ONLY, and the cards
 *    ids (":<card>,<dev>") are by construction the tokens miniaudio's
 *    simplified ALSA enumeration yields for the same hardware (the header
 *    comment on le_alsa_enumerate_cards), so resolution still pins. Before
 *    #649 this row fell to miniaudio's full ALSA probe: the whole PCM hint
 *    namespace, ~38 ms per mostly-failing channel query, ~950 ms per 1 Hz
 *    poll tick on a Pi — versus ~0.15 ms reading /proc/asound/cards.
 *
 * Every ALSA_CARDS row still has the portable miniaudio backstop behind it:
 * cards enumeration declines when no card has a PCM in the asked direction
