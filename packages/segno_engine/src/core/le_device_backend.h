/*
 * le_device_backend.h — the internal device-backend seam.
 *
 * A thin vtable (a struct of function pointers) plus a negotiated-info
 * out-struct that le_engine_start / le_engine_stop / le_engine_destroy drive
 * instead of calling ma_device_* directly. The engine selects one backend with
 * le_select_backend (engine.c) and owns the device lifecycle exclusively
 * through this interface. The real-time core (le_engine_process), the SPSC
 * command ring, the atomic snapshot, and the looper/lane/FX DSP are reused
 * unchanged; a backend impl only opens/starts/stops/closes the device and
 * pumps le_engine_process from its real-time callback.
 *
 * In this build the only implementation is the miniaudio backend
 * (engine_miniaudio.c). The opt-in Windows ASIO backend slots in later behind
 * le_select_backend.
 *
 * This is DISTINCT from the per-OS engine_platform.h seam: that seam covers
 * per-OS *capabilities* (Core Audio labels, JACK pinning) over a single shared
 * miniaudio device, whereas this seam swaps the device backend itself.
 *
 * Purely internal: NOT part of the FFI surface (segno_engine_api.h) or ffigen.
