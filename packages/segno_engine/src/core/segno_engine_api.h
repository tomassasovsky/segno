/*
 * segno_engine_api.h — the C ABI exposed to Dart via FFI.
 *
 * This is the single header consumed by ffigen. Everything here is POD or an
 * opaque handle; no C++; no callbacks into Dart. The audio callback that backs
 * this API performs no allocation, locking, or I/O (see engine.c).
 *
 * Scope: device lifecycle, per-input live monitoring, level metering, a loopback
 * round-trip latency harness, the lock-free command ring, and a multi-track,
 * multi-lane looper. Each track owns up to LE_MAX_LANES lanes; a lane records
 * one hardware input into its own clean mono buffer (never merged with sibling
 * lanes) with per-lane routing / volume / mute / effects, while the track owns
 * the shared transport (record / master-loop length / overdub / loop playback /
 * loop multiples / clear) and one undo span across all its lanes.

 *
 * The audio callback measuring its OWN lateness. Until this existed nothing on
 * the miniaudio backends (Linux/macOS) counted a missed deadline: xrun_count was
 * fed only by the Windows ASIO overload notification, so the appliance could not
 * tell a callback that ran long from one that ran fine. Observation only — no
 * audio behaviour depends on any of it.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, and where: the device backend's data callback wraps
 * le_engine_process between two monotonic clock reads (engine_miniaudio.c), so a
 * duration here is what the DEVICE's callback thread actually spent, and an
 * entry-to-entry gap is what the DEVICE actually experienced.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS A PERIOD SERVICE, NOT A CALLBACK. miniaudio's duplex loop does not
 * hand the engine one period per callback: it delivers min(capture, playback)
 * chunks, split further by the converter's stack buffer and by short readi()
 * returns, so one hardware period is typically serviced by k back-to-back
 * callbacks. Neither obvious per-callback deadline survives that:
 *
 *   - judging every callback against a FULL period under-reports badly (a
 *     callback doing a k-th of the work gets k times the deadline it needs, so a
 *     struggling device reads "all clear");
 *   - judging it against its own frames/rate over-reports just as badly, because
 *     le_engine_process has a fixed per-block cost — the command drain, the
 *     per-lane and per-monitor snapshot loops, the metering publish — that does
 *     NOT shrink with the block. A 16-frame tail block would be given 166 us for
 *     overhead a 64-frame block absorbs inside 666 us, and would land in the

 *
 * So consecutive callbacks are summed until they cover at least one nominal

 * fixed overhead is amortised over a real period by construction, which is also
 * the true deadline: the work for one period must fit inside one period. calls

 *
 * TWO WINDOWS, because the bug being hunted (#722: clicks ONLY while a
 * performance capture is armed) is a comparison, not an absolute: `session`
 * accumulates for the whole device session (reset per configure/start, exactly
 * like xrun_count), `armed` is reset by every le_perf_arm and so covers only
 * the armed window. "Unarmed" is read as the difference of the counts; the two
 * maxima are reported separately because a maximum cannot be subtracted.
 *
 * ON HEALTHY HARDWARE EVERY JUDGED FIELD READS ZERO: late_periods, gap_events,
 * max_gap_us and xruns are all 0, and the histogram sits in the low buckets.
 * That is a deliberate design constraint — an instrument that cries wolf on a
 * working rig is worse than no instrument, because the bench then chases it. */

   * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DISTINGUISH. An entry-to-entry span contains the

   *   - the device starved us: we returned promptly and it still came back

   *     reading the bench table is built on;
   *   - WE ran long: any single callback taking more than 1.5 nominal periods
   *     forces a gap event on the next entry by arithmetic alone. So this is
   *     NOT independent of `late_periods` — a badly overloaded engine moves
   *     both, and the pair moving together means "we were slow", not "two
   *     separate problems". (A merely late period service is not enough: the
   *     threshold is per-callback spacing, and a service is often several
   *     callbacks. It takes one callback past 1.5 periods.)
   * Read the two TOGETHER, never this one alone.
   *
   * Measured against the nominal period and NOT against the last block's
   * budget: on the split duplex loop the callbacks for one period arrive in a
   * burst and are then followed by a normal ~one-period wait, so a threshold
   * scaled to a sub-period block would fire at every single period boundary on
   * completely healthy hardware.
   *
   * NOT double-counted against `xruns`: an ALSA -EPIPE recovery also stalls the
   * loop, so a gap arriving within a few periods of a counted recovery is
   * suppressed. One physical dropout is counted once, under one name, and
   * max_gap_us is never pinned by a recovery stall — while a genuine stall

 * Sheeran manual's preset x click-mode matrix (song-mode-spec.md §1):
 *   - AUTO (0) + click off: tempo AND bar count are both derived from the
 *     recording (unchanged A1 sync_grid_to_loop path).
 *   - AUTO (0) + click on: bar count only is derived; an already-set tempo is
 *     never re-derived. With NO tempo set, this falls back to deriving both
 *     (the same as click off) — there is nothing else to preserve.
 *   - N bars + click off: the recording proceeds as an ordinary manual take;
 *     on finalize, tempo is derived from recorded-length / N — UNCONDITIONALLY,
 *     even over an existing manual/tapped tempo (the manual's explicit rule for
 *     this preset; distinct from AUTO's D7 "never re-derive" precedence).
 *   - N bars + click on: REQUIRES a tempo already set (source != none) at the
 *     moment recording begins, so frames-per-bar is computable — the defining
 *     recording then auto-finalizes into overdub at exactly N bars' worth of
 *     frames. An early record press before N bars disarms the preset (closes
 *     normally, like AUTO, per D17's general early-press rule). With NO tempo
 *     set at record start, auto-finalize cannot be armed (there is no way to
 *     know how many frames N bars is) — this degrades to the N-bars + click-off
 *     behavior: an ordinary manual take, tempo derived from length / N on
 *     finalize (documented A6 judgment call).
 * In every case the loop's AUDIO length is never altered — only tempo/bars are
 * set to describe it. Requires loop<->grid sync on (le_engine_set_sync_tempo);
 * with sync off the preset is dormant (matches a plain grid-off recording).

 * rather than silently failing mid-take. This is a best-effort check against
 * the signature live NOW: nothing locks the signature/tempo between setting
 * the preset and actually recording (no track has content yet, so D6's lock
 * does not apply), so a change in between can still make an N-bars+click-on
 * take's auto-finalize target unreachable. That case is re-guarded with the
