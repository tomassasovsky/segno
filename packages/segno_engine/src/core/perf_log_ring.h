/*
 * perf_log_ring.h — single-producer/single-consumer lock-free ring for
 * performance-recording event-log entries.
 *
 * lockfree_ring.h's le_ring carries POD commands from control -> audio; this is
 * a sibling ring for the reverse concern this part adds: while performance
 * capture is armed, every audibility-affecting command applied by the audio
 * thread (plus a handful of transport facts — record start/end, loop length
 * locked, layer retired) is tagged with the capture frame it occurred at and
 * pushed here, to be drained to disk by perf_drain.c's background thread (see
 * docs/design/performance-event-log-format.md for the on-disk format and the
 * full audited command table).
 *
 * Two independent instances of this ring exist per le_perf_capture (see
 * engine_private.h): one with the AUDIO thread as producer (apply_command +
 * the per-frame transport-fact call sites), one with the CONTROL thread as
 * producer (the direct-atomic setters that bypass the command ring entirely —
 * FX/monitor params, the limiter, overdub feedback, and the common in-track
 * undo/redo swap). Each individual ring is strictly single-producer, matching
 * every other ring in this codebase; splitting by producer thread — rather
 * than trying to make one ring safe for two concurrent producers — is what
 * keeps both instances wait-free with zero new synchronization primitives.
 * The drain thread pops both every cycle and appends both streams to the same
 * events.log file; entries are monotonic in frame *within* each stream but the
 * two streams are not globally merged/sorted (see the format doc).
