/*
 * layer_staging_ring.h — single-producer/single-consumer ring of retired
 * overdub-layer PCM copies, staged for persistence (part 5, D-LAYER).
 *
 * The hazard this exists to close: a completed overdub pass ("layer") lives
 * in a fixed-size per-track pool (LE_POOL_SLOTS). When the pool fills, the
 * oldest undo layer's slot is evicted and reused; clearing a track, or
 * starting a fresh punch-in after an undo (redo-invalidation), reclaims
 * slots the same way. None of that touches the buffer's bytes directly, but
 * the NEXT write to a reclaimed slot overwrites them — so audio that
 * genuinely played can be silently destroyed with no record it ever existed.
 *
 * The fix: while performance capture is armed, every retiring layer's PCM is
 * copied into a fresh heap buffer (control thread, at the moment
 * le_handle_retired processes its LE_EVT_LAYER_RETIRED event — see
 * engine_commands.c) and handed to this ring. perf_drain.c's background
 * thread pops entries and writes them to numbered files, independent of
 * whatever the live pool slot goes on to do afterward.
 *
 * Control-thread-producer, drain-thread-consumer — the same single-producer
 * discipline as every other ring in this engine, and the same "control
 * allocates, drain thread frees" ownership handoff perf_drain.c already uses
 * for nothing else (this is the first ring in this engine whose entries own
 * heap memory rather than being flat PODs — see the struct doc below).
