/*
 * engine_cache.c — the Loop-stage wet cache (FX v3 part 2).
 *
 * When a lane's record-route chain is STABLE, a single background worker [B6]
 * renders the lane's whole loop offline — dry PCM x pre-chain volume through
 * the engine's own fx_apply_chain, verbatim on a heap le_fx_state (the
 * perf_render pattern; no forked DSP) — and the audio thread plays the cached
 * stereo result at zero FX CPU. Any edit falls back to live processing within
 * one buffer. Design rule: when in doubt, play live. The cache is invisible,
 * never destructive, and never allowed to play stale audio.
 *
 * THREAD OWNERSHIP — the [R2] contract, clause by clause:
 *  (a) Dry-PCM handoff is COPY-AT-ENQUEUE: the CONTROL thread (le_cache_tick)
 *      copies pool[a_live] into a worker-owned buffer, only while the track is
 *      not RECORDING/OVERDUBBING and no overdub layer is in flight (the fade
 *      tail and drain both hold a_layer_in_flight), tagged with the
 *      a_audio_rev it copied under and re-checked at copy completion (seqlock
 *      shape). The copy is CHUNKED across ticks (le_cache_copy_step, bounded
 *      per call) so the UI-poll drain path never stalls behind one giant
 *      memcpy. A finished render whose revision moved is discarded. In-flight
 *      copies count against the memory cap. The control thread owns all pool
 *      management (alloc/shrink/a_live swaps), so a control-side copy can
 *      never race a pool free.
 *  (b) Wet-buffer publication mirrors the fx->plugin[] discipline
 *      (engine_plugin.c): entries are control-allocated, fully written, then
 *      published as ONE atomic pointer (le_lane.a_wet, release) whose key the
 *      audio thread re-derives and checks once per buffer. Publication and
 *      retraction are CONTROL-THREAD-ONLY (single writer); the worker never
 *      touches a_wet — it only fills its job slot, which the next tick
 *      collects, validates ([B5]: key must still match), and publishes.
 *  (c) Reclamation uses the engine_plugin.c clear-slot pattern's SAFETY RULE
 *      — retract the pointer, then observe two processed-buffer boundaries
 *      via a_frames before freeing — but observes them PASSIVELY: a retracted
 *      entry moves to a graveyard list and the tick frees it once a_frames
 *      has been seen to change twice since retraction (or immediately with no
 *      audio thread). No control-thread sleep, ever — the UI's snapshot poll
 *      must never stall on cache housekeeping. A stalled device callback just
 *      parks the graveyard (bounded); never a use-after-free.
 *  (d) Join-before-free: le_cache_shutdown joins the worker and is called
 *      from le_engine_stop, the top of le_engine_configure, and
 *      le_engine_destroy BEFORE any pool or wet-buffer free.
 *
 * The job queue is a fixed slot array with SPSC state machines (control:
 * EMPTY -> QUEUED and DONE/ABORTED/FAILED -> EMPTY; worker: QUEUED -> RUNNING
 * -> DONE/ABORTED/FAILED), so no mutex exists anywhere in the engine and the
 * audio thread is untouched. The worker polls (bounded 1 ms sleeps), renders
 * the loop TWICE back-to-back and keeps the second pass, so delay/reverb
 * tails that wrap the loop boundary are baked in; it aborts early when it
 * observes an a_audio_rev bump for its lane [B5] or shutdown.
