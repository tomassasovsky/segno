/*
 * perf_drain.h — the performance-recording capture-to-disk subsystem (part 2
 * of the DAW-export stack).
 *
 * A dedicated background thread — spawned by le_perf_arm, joined by
 * le_perf_disarm — that drains part 1's capture rings (audio_ring.h) into raw
 * float PCM temp files plus a `performance.json` sidecar, flushing every
 * ~250 ms. WAV headers are written only at finalize (a later part): a crash
 * mid-capture leaves salvageable raw PCM + a parseable sidecar, never a
 * truncated WAV (umbrella D-FMT).
 *
 * Lifecycle sibling of the plugin scan thread (host/plugin_scan.cpp), but
 * this one is plain C (no SDK dependency) so it lives in core/ alongside the
 * rest of the engine. Thread ownership: engine_commands.c's le_perf_arm/
 * disarm are the only callers; this module never touches the audio thread or
 * the command ring (a background thread pushing commands would be a second
 * producer on the control thread's SPSC ring — never done here).
