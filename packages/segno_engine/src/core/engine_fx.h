/*
 * engine_fx.h — the per-lane effects DSP island's cross-TU surface.
 *
 * The effects DSP lives in engine_fx.c (S1 split from engine.c): the built-in
 * effect kernels, the phase-vocoder / PSOLA octaver, the Freeverb reverb, and
 * the chain runner. This header exposes only what the rest of the engine needs:
 * the chain entry point (audio thread), the per-slot reset/free helpers (audio +
 * control thread), the active-octaver latency query (control thread), and the
 * one-time Hann-window init (control thread). The per-sample kernels (fx_drive,
 * fx_reverb, …) stay private to engine_fx.c.
 *
 * The phase-vocoder / PSOLA tuning constants live here too because the control
 * thread sizes the octaver's heap buffers (LE_PV_N / LE_PV_BINS) in
 * le_fx_prepare_entry — they are the single source of truth shared by the DSP
 * and its allocator.
