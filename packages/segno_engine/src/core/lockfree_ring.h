/*
 * lockfree_ring.h — single-producer / single-consumer lock-free command ring.
 *
 * The control side (Dart, via FFI) is the sole producer; the real-time audio
 * callback thread is the sole consumer. push/pop are wait-free and perform no
 * allocation, making them safe to call from the audio callback.
 *
 * Capacity must be a power of two. The ring stores fixed-size POD commands so
 * the audio thread never dereferences control-owned heap memory.
