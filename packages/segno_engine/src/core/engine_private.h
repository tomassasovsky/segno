 *
 * - le_track.bus — the TRACK-stage chain (D-TRACKROUTE): when non-empty, the

 *   EMPTINESS, not enabled: a non-empty but chain-disabled chain keeps the
 *   bus topology (part 1a's bypass makes it dry), so a stomp toggles DSP,
 *   never routing.
 *
 * - le_engine.master_fx — the engine-level Master insert (D-MASTER): runs on
 *   the summed track mix between mix_tracks_frame and mix_monitors_frame, so
 *   live monitor signals — summed after it — stay uncolored, and master
 *   gain/limiter (master_bus_frame, unchanged) still applies to both.
 *   D-MASTERCH: FX kernels are strict stereo, so for ch_out != 2 the chain
 *   processes the FIRST ENABLED output pair and passes other channels through
 *   bit-exact dry; ch_out == 1 processes mono as l == r.
 *
 * Both default empty with every enable flag 1, so old sessions and fresh
 * engines behave identically (dry). Enable flips are direct atomic stores

 *
 * True only when ALL of:
 *   - mode is SYNC or BAND;
 *   - a primary track is crowned (a_primary_track >= 0) and it is not [ch]
 *     itself (the primary's own recording never quantizes against itself —
 *     also correctly excludes the primary's OWN first-ever defining take,
 *     see the a_len check below);
 *   - the primary track already has content (lane 0's a_len > 0, read
 *     BEFORE finalize_new_track mutates anything for [ch] — so if [ch] IS
 *     the primary mid its own first recording, a_len still reads its
 *     pre-take value: 0 the very first time, correctly reading "not yet
 *     established" and falling back to ordinary Multi-style rounding, the
 *     documented D16 fallback);
 *   - the primary's own recorded length is EXACTLY one base loop
 *     (a_multiple == 1 AND a_sync_divisor == 0 — BOTH are required: a Sync
 *     DIVISION track also publishes a_multiple == 1 inertly alongside its
 *     nonzero divisor, so a_multiple alone cannot tell "one plain base
 *     loop" apart from "a fractional slice of some OTHER track" —
 *     adversarial-review BUG 3. Without the divisor check, crowning a
 *     division track as primary would make every downstream formula treat
 *     its fractional length as if it were a full base loop, corrupting
 *     the math for every dependent track. Checked here — the one gate both
 *     threads consult — rather than at crown time (le_engine_crown_primary
 *     stays unconditional per D18: the crown is a persistent designation,
 *     settable before content even exists), matching this file's existing
 *     "recompute live, don't trust the setter" discipline (see
 *     le_effective_multiple, le_looper_mode_locked). A track crowned while
 *     holding a divisor simply reads as "not yet established" — the same
 *     D16 fallback as no primary at all, so every OTHER track's
 *     recording degrades gracefully to ordinary Multi-style behavior
 *     rather than corrupting). This is what lets every formula below use
 *     e->clock.length directly as "the primary's length": if some OTHER
 *     track happened to record first and define e->clock (D16's fallback
 *     lets that happen), and the primary later records into that
 *     already-established master as a k != 1 multiple, e->clock.length no
 *     longer equals the primary's own length — a rare mis-ordering this
 *     conservatively falls back on rather than risk incoherent divide/
 *     multiply math (documented limitation, not a crash — and largely
 *     closed by finalize_new_track's le_is_reestablishing_primary path,
 *     engine_process.c, which now forces the primary's OWN recording to
