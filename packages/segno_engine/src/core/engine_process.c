 * engine_process.c — THE AUDIO-THREAD TU.
 *
 * Everything the device callback runs lives here and nowhere else: the real-time
 * contract holds for this whole file — no malloc/free, no locks, no syscalls, no
 * unbounded loops. le_engine_process is the block processor the miniaudio / ASIO
 * data callback pumps; it drains the SPSC command ring (apply_command), advances
 * the transport state machine (the finalize_* / handle_* helpers), records /
 * overdubs / mixes, runs the per-lane effect chains (fx_apply_chain), resolves the
 * loopback latency harness, and publishes metering + visualization atomics.
 *
 * Split verbatim out of engine.c (S1) behind the unchanged ABI. The transport
 * handlers live here rather than in a separate engine_transport.c because they run
 * ON the audio thread (invoked only by apply_command and le_engine_process); the
 * control-thread record/undo entry points (le_engine_record etc.) are in
 * engine_commands.c. Shared low-level helpers (valid_channel, le_track_set_len,
 * comp_pos, le_lanes_active) come from engine_core.h; the chain runner from
 * engine_fx.h.

 * capturing at the CURRENT transport position, not a beat boundary) — must
 * NOT get this treatment: firing immediately there would click at whatever
 * arbitrary phase the punch landed on, not a real beat (confirmed bug:
 * 300 BPM, punch mid-beat fired a click ~112 ms after the true beat onset).
 * Leaving grid_prev_beat alone on those rises is exactly right, because it

 *
 * The shadow holds the pre-pass image, and the corrected pre-pass image is the

 * inside the first F/2 frames after the finalize. od_fade_frames is the same
 * sr/100 as F, so a dub punched out at frame p has only ramped to p/F and
 * decays back to 0 by frame 2p; LE_DRAIN_CHUNK (32768 samples) then drains the
 * whole remaining pass in a single block, and the layer retires while the fold
 * is still counting down. Measured at 48 kHz (F = 480): punch-out at 64 or 192
 * leaves the raw seam (score 204x, step 0.352), at 240 or 600 the folded one
 * (1.6x, 0.003) — pinned both ways by

 * Concretely: clearing the primary while a dependent Sync track survives
 * keeps e->clock alive (handle_clear only resets it when EVERY track is

 * truncates any overflow past one base loop (the same "can round DOWN"
 * behavior le_sync_choose_ratio already has for ordinary non-primary
 * tracks) rather than ever changing the shared base a sibling depends on.
 * A useful side effect: this also closes the "someone else recorded
 * first, defining e->clock, before the primary's own first take"
 * mis-ordering le_sync_quantize_active's doc used to flag as a documented

   *     add a second one.
   *
   *   - a_record_offset > 0 — i.e. EVERY latency-calibrated rig. Compensation
   *     writes input frame i at position i - offset, so a take that ran to
   *     `len` leaves its head at len - offset and the last `offset` frames of
   *     the buffer as those same prepared zeros. record_pos - offset == len
   *     therefore cannot hold on the auto path (auto rounds up, so len >=
   *     record_pos, and the equality needs offset <= 0), and on the fixed-
   *     multiple path only when record_start happens to equal offset. So the
   *     fold silently does not run there, and that is the honest outcome: the
   *     buffer's true last sample is at len - offset - 1 and what follows it is
   *     already IN the loop, not past it — there is nothing to capture and no
   *     seam of the assumed shape to smooth. Refusing leaves such a take
   *     exactly as it was before #728; giving the offset path a seam of its own
   *     means first fixing the trailing-zeros gap it shares with #730, which is

 * e->clock.length / divisor (le_sync_quantize_active guarantees the primary
 * is exactly one base loop whenever a division was created, so no separate
 * lookup is needed); trk_pos[t] is `pos % trk_len[t]`, folding the
 * primary's CURRENT phase into the division's own shorter cycle.
 *
 * base / divisor is an EXACT integer division with NO remainder here —
 * adversarial-review BUG 2 fix: le_sync_choose_ratio (finalize_new_track)
 * now only ever publishes a divisor that tiles the primary's length
 * exactly (base % divisor == 0), stepping down (4 -> 2) or falling back to
 * an ordinary multiple otherwise, rather than this function's old
 * `llround(base / n)` — which, whenever the primary's length wasn't evenly
 * divisible by n (the ORDINARY case for a freely-recorded primary, not a
 * rare edge case), silently repeated or skipped one buffer index every
 * single cycle: an audible, permanent stutter. With base % divisor == 0
 * guaranteed on write, `pos % trk_len[t]` now tiles PROVABLY exactly:
 * over one full primary cycle (pos sweeping 0..base-1), it visits every
 * one of the divisor's own trk_len[t] indices exactly `divisor` times,
 * with no repeats and no skips, for any pos — not just at pos == 0.
 *
 * Deliberately anchored to `pos` (the primary's live phase), not a running
 * iteration/segment count like the multiple path's seg_base: whenever pos
 * == 0 (the primary's loop top), pos % trk_len[t] == 0 too, for ANY
 * trk_len[t] > 0 — so a division track's own loop-top ALWAYS coincides
 * with the primary's, on every primary cycle, regardless of how many times
 * either has wrapped. A half-length division therefore completes exactly 2
 * of its own loops per 1 primary loop, phase-aligned at the start — the
 * behavior a musician expects from a half-length loop layered under a
 * full-length one. (seg_base itself already reads 0 for these tracks with
 * no changes needed: finalize_new_track sets a_multiple to 1 for a
 * division, so the existing `seg = (iter - start_iter) % 1` collapses to 0
 * unconditionally.)
 *
 * Per-track, not mode-gated (mirrors free_track_positions_frame's shape but
 * checks per-track state instead of a single outer mode flag): a_sync_
 * divisor is only ever set nonzero by finalize_new_track under le_sync_
 * quantize_active, which requires SYNC/BAND, so this is mutually exclusive
 * with Free mode's own per-track free_clock by construction — cheap
