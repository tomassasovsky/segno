/*
 * native_window_controller.h — host-owned native editor window (macOS).
 *
 * A tiny C ABI over an AppKit NSWindow so the C++ VST3/CLAP host backends
 * (host_vst3.cpp / host_clap.cpp) can open a top-level editor window WITHOUT
 * importing AppKit themselves — all Objective-C lives in
 * native_window_controller.mm. The window is host-owned and not embedded in the
 * Flutter view tree (umbrella D-WIN), sidestepping the child-window limitation.
 *
 * MAIN THREAD ONLY. The plugin attaches its view to the window's contentView
 * (a plain NSView). When the plugin requests a resize it calls lpw_window_resize;
 * when the user closes the window (red button) the on_close callback fires so the
 * host can detach + release the plugin view exactly once.
