// Vendored-SDK include probe (part 1 of the VST3/CLAP plugin-hosting stack).
//
// This translation unit contains NO host logic. Its only job is to prove that
// the vendored VST3 and CLAP headers resolve and compile in the engine build,
// so later parts of the stack can `#include` them without re-litigating the
// build wiring. The pass/fail criterion for part 1 is "this TU compiles."
//
// It is compiled only when SEGNO_ENABLE_PLUGINS is defined — default ON for the
// macOS SPM / CocoaPods builds (see Package.swift and segno_engine.podspec),
// and OFF for the Windows/Linux CMake builds, where plugin hosting lands in
// parts 8–9. When the flag is off this file is an empty object, exactly like
// the OS-guarded platform/MIDI seams.
//
// Include roots are supplied by the build system, not relative paths here, so
// the SDKs' own root-relative cross-includes (e.g. "pluginterfaces/base/...")
// resolve the same way the real host code will use them:
//   - VST3:  third_party/vst3sdk          -> "pluginterfaces/base/ipluginbase.h"
//   - CLAP:  third_party/clap/include     -> <clap/entry.h>
