/*
 * plugin_slot.h — internal interface to a hosted-plugin chain slot.
 *
 * C-compatible (used from the C engine: engine_fx.c calls the per-sample
 * adapter; engine_plugin.c manages the lifecycle). The real implementation is
 * host/slot.cpp (SEGNO_ENABLE_PLUGINS); other builds link the stubs in
 * core/plugin_disabled.c so the symbols always resolve.
 *
 * Threads (umbrella D-LIFE):
 *   - le_plugin_slot_process runs ON THE AUDIO THREAD and only ever reads an
 *     atomically-published "ready" flag — never allocates, locks, or frees.
 *   - every other function runs on the CONTROL thread.
