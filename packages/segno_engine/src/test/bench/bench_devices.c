/*
 * bench_devices.c — what one tick of the audio-device picker's refresh costs.
 *
 * NOT part of the test gate. Build and run it with ./bench_devices.sh.
 *
 * WHY: AudioSetupCubit re-enumerates on a 1 Hz Timer.periodic, synchronously
 * over FFI on the UI isolate, in BOTH directions. One tick is therefore one
 * le_enumerate_playback_devices + one le_enumerate_capture_devices — that pair
 * is the unit this bench reports, because that pair is what the UI isolate
 * actually blocks on. Any figure per-direction or per-device understates it.
 *
 * The four modes separate the cost that was always there from the cost the
 * channel-count query added:
 *
 *   real     the shipped le_enumerate_* pair, whatever this platform does.
 *            On macOS/Windows that is the miniaudio path, with the per-device
 *            channel counts served from engine_devices.c's memo table — so a
 *            steady rig reads the memo's cost, not the query's. On Linux
 *            le_platform_enumerate_devices takes it (ALSA cards on the
 *            appliance, JACK ports on the desktop) and returns before
 *            device_info_copy, so `real` there is the platform seam and NOT
 *            the miniaudio path below — and the counts are not filled at all.
 *   ma-lean  a local replica of the miniaudio path WITHOUT any per-device
 *            query: le_probe_context_init, ma_context_get_devices, copy, uninit.
 *            What enumeration costs when only the cheap list is read. The
 *            replicas open their context through the shipped
 *            le_probe_context_init, not a bare ma_context_init, so they keep
 *            the same backend pin the real path has (#721) — otherwise the
 *            bench would both measure a backend walk the app no longer does and
 *            leak a memfd per iteration on the very appliance it is run to
 *            verify.
 *   ma-full  the same replica WITH ma_context_get_device_info per device, every
 *            time. ma-full minus ma-lean is what the counts cost UNMEMOISED —
 *            which is both what the memo table saves on macOS and what Linux
 *            would start paying if the count gap there were closed naively.
 *            Held as a local replica so both arms stay measurable on one binary
 *            after the memo landed; the control arm must not disappear just
 *            because the shipped path got faster.
 *   ctx      ma_context_init + ma_context_uninit alone, nothing else. The
 *            floor every mode pays twice per tick, and the number that says
 *            whether the per-device query or the context churn dominates.
 *   perdev   every single ma_context_get_device_info timed on its own, printed
 *            per device with its name. Says whether the added cost is spread
 *            evenly (so it scales with the device count) or concentrated in
 *            one slow device, and it names that device if so — which decides
 *            whether caching per device id is worth it.
 *
 * The replicas exist so the delta can be read on a single binary with no
 * production edits and no rebuild between arms — and so Linux can report what
 * the miniaudio path WOULD cost there, even though the seam short-circuits
 * before it today.
 *
 * On the appliance, run it the way the appliance runs (segno-kiosk-launch sets
 * SEGNO_ALSA_ONLY=1), and leave segno.service up: enumeration uses a transient
 * context and never opens the card, so measuring alongside the running app is
 * both safe and the honest condition — that is when the 1 Hz poll actually
 * fires.
 *
 *   SEGNO_ALSA_ONLY=1 ./bench_devices --iters 100
 *
 * Usage: ./bench_devices [--iters N] [--mode real|ma-lean|ma-full|ctx|perdev|all]
