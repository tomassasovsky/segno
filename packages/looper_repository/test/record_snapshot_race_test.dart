/// The bug: recording an input that has monitor FX yielded a DRY take because
/// the engine self-snapshotted from its own ring-deferred monitor state — if
/// record fired before the audio thread drained the FX write, it copied
/// nothing. The fix makes the repository the single record-time snapshot
/// authority: it computes the snapshot from its synchronous cache and pushes it
/// to the engine like any other lane edit, so the take's chain lands regardless
/// of drain timing. This test sets a monitor chain and records WITHOUT a drain
/// in between (the widest race window) and asserts the take's lane chain equals
/// the monitored one after a single drain.
///
/// Self-skips when `SEGNO_ENGINE_LIB` is unset; build it first:
///   export SEGNO_ENGINE_LIB="$(bash packages/segno_engine/tool/build_test_lib.sh)"
